serious artform, and tea can play a big part in this. These tea houses in Bangkok will wash any problems away for the afternoon.\r\n\r\nTea is really to find in the city, but a tea house is a whole different subject. You need somewhere comfortable to properly soak it all in, for tea, done with care, is a whole experience. Of course, some opt for an afternoon tea set at one of the many luxury hotels in Bangkok, but some times you just need something relaxing, something lowkey. You need somewhere judgment free, with a lot of options to choose from, but not too many that it overwhelms the senses.\r\n\r\nWe exactly know what you're looking for: these tea houses in Bangkok could be what you need. Read on for all the details.\r\n\r\n[Featured image credit: Max Chen\/Unsplash; hero image credit: Araksa Tea Room\/Facebook]\r\nBest tea houses in Bangkok for serious teas and calming ambiance\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936135\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Image credit: Double Dogs\/Facebook[\/caption]\r\nDouble Dogs Tearoom\r\nDouble Dogs has been a staple establishment in Yaowarat for over a decade, offering a wide range of quality tea leaves from all over Asia. Whether you're looking for somewhere to sit and relax, or craving for something adventurous, the owner will gladly help pick out something that is just right for the afternoon. They also have light bites to go with the tea, and they sell utensils and tea cups for you to take home and try out your own brew.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0Double Dogs Tearoom\r\nOpening times: Thu-Mon, 11am-6pm\r\nLocation: Tae Lao Chin Seng, 406 Yaowarat Rd, Chakkrawat, Samphanthawong, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Wat Mangkon, MRT\r\nGoogle Review rating: 4.5\/5\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936219\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2560\"] Image credit: Asiatique Ancient Tea House[\/caption]\r\nAsiatique Ancient Tea House\r\nLocated inside a century-old heritage house, Asiatique Ancient Tea House boasts a wide selection of teas from all over the world. Of course, they have the pu'ers and genmaichas you may recognise, but let their tea sommelier recommend you something a bit out of your comfort zone; perhaps the Chinese silver needle white tea, 8 flowers tea from Tisane, or even organic Thai teas. While you're enjoying your beverage, browse through their food menu for something more filling, from dim sum to Chinese-style fried rice.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0Asiatique Ancient Tea House\r\nOpening times: Open daily, 12pm-midnight\r\nLocation: Asiatique, 76 Soi Charoen Krung 72, Wat Phraya Krai, Bang Kho Laem, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Saphan Taksin, BTS\r\nGoogle Review rating: 4.7\/5\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936220\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1440\"] Image credit: Mitramit Teahouse\/Facebook[\/caption]\r\nMitramit Teahouse\r\nThe sign in front of Mitramit Teahouse reads, \"sipping tea, meeting friends, and enjoying life,\" which is exactly what guests of the establishment never fail to do. Their way of serving tea is through a set, comprised of hot Chinese tea paired with a delicacy, for which the owner is more than happy to recommend your next favourite. Dishes seem to rotate regularly, and coupled with the laidback ambiance with beautiful Chinese interior, Mitramit is very easy to return to. Recently, they even paired one of their green teas with pork satay.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0Mitramit Teahouse\r\nOpening times: Sat-Thu, 2-9pm\r\nLocation: 32 Phra Sumen Rd, Chana Songkhram, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Sam Yot, MRT\r\nGoogle Review rating: 4.6\/5\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936221\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1080\"] Image credit: Casa Formosa Taiwan Tea House\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\nCasa Formosa Taiwan Tea House\r\nTucked inside the small Vanich 1 soi is the Casa Formosa Taiwan Tea House, boasting Taiwanese teas carefully selected by the owner.

With a mix of Malay, Chinese, and Indian influences, Malaysia is a paradise for foodies eager to dive into a world of flavours. Sure, nasi lemak may be the country\u2019s unofficial national dish, but let\u2019s not forget the noodle scene\u2014it's packed with gems. From plates of wan tan mee and cosy bowls of laksa to a midnight fix of smoky Hokkien mee, you\u2019ll never run out of noodle options in Malaysia. Yet, there\u2019s one dish that deserves just as much fanfare as pizza does in Naples: beef noodles.\r\n\r\nThese beef noodles are a mouthwatering combination of springy noodles, tender beef, and deeply savoury sauces or broths that could convert even the most die-hard rice lovers. Originating from the Tang Dynasty in China, the classic\u00a0Lanzhou la mian\u00a0has inspired numerous Malaysian versions.\r\n\r\nTrue to Malaysia\u2019s love of variety, beef noodles here come in multiple forms, from dry to soupy, topped with everything from thin beef slices and meatballs to innards for the bold. Finished off with minced meat sauce made with fermented soybean paste, and chopped spring onions, it\u2019s a bowl that just won\u2019t quit.\r\n\r\nThen there\u2019s braised beef brisket noodles, or\u00a0ngau lam fun\u00a0in Cantonese, which stars melt-in-your-mouth brisket, beef tendon, and the hero of it all\u2014chu hou sauce which is essentially fermented soybean paste, adding a kick of flavour that\u2019s impossible to resist.\r\n\r\nWith so many delicious variations, Malaysians simply call them all \u2018beef noodles\u2019 and focus on enjoying every bite. We\u2019ve scoured KL and Selangor to find the very best spots for a bowl that\u2019ll hit the spot\u2014because everyone deserves a noodle dish worth dreaming about.\r\n\r\n(Hero and feature images credit: Instagram\/ @yangkibeefnoodles)\r\nA guide to the best spots for beef noodles in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor\r\n"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"10 of the best nightclubs in Bangkok to party till you drop","position":3,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/dining\/drinks\/best-nightclubs-in-bangkok-2024\/","description":"When it comes to finding the best nightclubs in Bangkok, it's all about vibes and sick beats.

Time to head to London, as Ikea has opened its first standalone restaurant in Hammersmith.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish furniture giant has decided to become a food service player like any other, or almost. Ikea has replicated all the codes of its in-store canteens in a standalone space that no longer requires customers to navigate the aisles in order to grab a bite to eat.\r\n\r\nOf course, diners will find meatballs and their vegetarian counterparts on the menu. Indeed, Ikea's iconic dishes are now being served in what is the Swedish furniture giant's first-ever restaurant outside a store. In other words, anyone who feels like indulging in Ikea's mashed potatoes will no longer have to wind their way through the various aisles of sofas and lamps in order to get their fill. In London's Hammersmith district, Ikea has replicated all the codes of its in-store canteens in a standalone space on King Street, a busy part of this corner of the British capital between Richmond and Notting Hill.\r\nIkea opens its first standalone restaurant in London\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935647\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Ikea[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the place of a former sushi and bento restaurant, Ikea is now welcoming customers to a 75-seat eatery serving dishes including fish and chips, pasta with tomato sauce, and salmon with couscous. Like the catering outlets in its stores, the space is laid out as a self-service area with pay stations. Customers can come from breakfast -- when omelettes, bacon and hash browns are served -- through to dinner. According to the Guardian, the Ikea standalone is also serving items from its bistro and caf\u00e9 menus, such as ice creams, a selection of desserts, and hot dogs. Plus, customers can enjoy the traditional Swedish \u201cfika\u201d break with coffee and a sweet treat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, this Ikea eatery is not a restaurant like any other. There is no music, for example, and customers can also sit down to work in the restaurant. Unsurprisingly, Ikea hasn't opened this eatery just anywhere. The restaurant is, in fact, attached to the retailer's brand-new Hammersmith store. Above all, its opening comes at a time when many people in the UK are feeling the effects of a cost of living crisis. Household food budgets have been impacted by soaring inflation, reaching a record +19% in March 2023. But while the pace has slowed since the summer, food prices remain very high. As such, dishes like children's pasta with tomato sauce for \u00a30.95 (approx. THB 42), or veggie meatballs with mashed potatoes, peas, cream sauce and lingonberry jam for \u00a34.95 (approx. THB 220), could find plenty of takers.\r\n\r\nThis story is published via AFP Relaxnews.\u00a0"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"10 speakeasies in Bangkok that are actually kind of hard to find","position":14,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/dining\/drinks\/hidden-bars-you-should-know-in-bangkok\/","description":"To all the Thai review pages out there: just because a bar isn't on the main road doesn't make it a \"hidden bar.\" Here's a look at speakeasies in Bangkok that are worth going to (once you find them).\r\n\r\nApart from the food and the shopping, one of the things Bangkok is certainly known for is the nightlife.

If it\u2019s a sandwich, you\u2019re in luck. According to a recent study, sandwiches are the most popular lunch in the world.\r\nWhen it comes to lunch, every employee has their own culinary preferences. Some swear by a good hearty meal, while others prefer to eat something on the go. But according to a recent survey, the most popular choice of working people for their lunch break is the iconic sandwich.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the culinary habits of workers around the world: What is the most popular lunch?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935269\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Crystal Jo\/Unsplash[\/caption]\r\nThe KickResume website examined the culinary habits of workers in 28 countries around the world. It turns out that many of them like to eat food typical of their country during their lunch break. In Germany, for example, working people eat a bread roll topped with bratwurst, the emblematic pork sausage of the German-speaking world, while Canadians like to indulge in poutine, a dish of soft cheese fries drowned in brown gravy. In Indonesia, rendang -- the national dish from the island of Sumatra made with meat, coconut milk and spices -- is a hit with the working population.\r\nWhile each country has its own specialties, the sandwich remains the preferred lunchtime option for Norwegians, Swedes, Greenlanders, French, New Zealanders, Italians and Britons. And understandably so: every culture in the world has its own version of this dish. The French have ham with butter, while the Scandinavians have sm\u00f8rbr\u00f8d, a buttered slice of rye bread topped with cold meats, fish, eggs or condiments.\r\n\r\nThe sandwich has the advantage of being easy to eat: it's eaten it on the go, with one hand, without a plate or cutlery. Ideal when you want to take advantage of your lunch break to \u201cscroll\u201d social media on your phone or work on a file in peace and quiet, while your colleagues are in the cafeteria. This dish also has a reputation for being inexpensive -- even if some elaborate formats are sold for over US$12.\r\n\r\nEmployees are increasingly attentive to what they spend during their lunch break and with good reason. Seventy-eight percent of American employees say they have changed their lunch habits, according to the 2024 edition of ezCater's \u201cLunch Report.\u201d Most of them are cutting back on outings to restaurants with colleagues and preparing their own lunch to take to the office. But that doesn't mean they enjoy it: seven out of ten Americans feel that the time they spend in the kitchen prepping their lunch interferes with their leisure time.\r\nWhen it comes to money, KickResume's survey reveals that employees in Greenland treat themselves to the most expensive meals during their lunch break. They spend over $26 on lunch, equivalent to 8% of their salary. Swedes, Turks and Canadians are just as big spenders, with lunch breaks costing between 13 and 17 dollars.\r\nThis story is published via AFP Relaxnews.

Travelling across Asia as part of her \u2018Radical Optimism\u2019 World Tour, the Albanian singer and songwriter has been sampling street food in Asia where she can, sipping plum tea, digging into laksa, and even asking fans for local recommendations. As we prep for the star\u2019s arrival in Bangkok, we had a few local street food suggestions ourselves. Radically optimistic, we hope you see this, Dua.\r\nArguably the street food capital of the world (fight us), we could not be more excited to see Dua Lipa in Bangkok. The Asia leg of her \u2018Radical Optimism\u2019 tour will have seen stops in Singapore, the Philippines, Japan, Taipei, and Kuala Lumpur, before she arrives to Bangkok on 27 November 2024. Clearly, this is a tough roster of street food destinations to compete with, so we need to get in early with the recommendations. Any true foodie plans their meals (and their stomach space) in advance.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/DCBmiiQTPCz\/\r\nNonetheless, while Singapore was a good amuse bouche, Bangkok\u2019s street food scene is arguably more vast and varied, covering different (and distanced) areas of the city, providing a mix of regional Thai, Thai-Chinese, Indian, and even Japanese dishes to savour. From the classics on Yaowarat Road, and the newcomers on Banthat Thong Road, over to Youtube-famous spice and Netflix-renowned spots, here\u2019s all the street food Dua Lipa should try in Bangkok. Unlike in her Instagram post in Singapore, she need not ask us twice.\r\n\r\nBest street food in Bangkok: The Bangkok food spots and Thai dishes Dua Lipa should try\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935244\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: @dualipa\/Instagram (left), Nai Mong Hai Tod\/Facebook (right)[\/caption]\r\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious one: Yaowarat Road (Chinatown) for noodles, crab curry, and oyster omelette \r\nThis is Thailand Street Food 101. Ask anybody where to go for a good Thai street food experience, and it is likely that Bangkok\u2019s Chinatown on Yaowarat Road will come up first. It\u2019s convenient because Dua and the gang can walk up and down this street, easily stopping for snacks like squid eggs with spicy sauce, pork satay at Je Aeng, or the indulgent Patongko Savoey (fried dough).\r\nStreet food restaurant highlights on Yaowarat Road include Guay Ouan Pochana for rice roll noodle soup with crispy pork, Jek Pui for Netflix-famed assorted curries, or Nai Mong Hai Tod for oyster omelette. We know Dua Lipa tried the famous chili crab in Singapore already, and we have a feeling she\u2019d love our Thai-Chinese crab curry at T&K Seafood, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935245\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Rong Klan Nuea\/Facebook (left), @dualipa\/Instagram (right)[\/caption]\r\nFor a coffee break nearby, Dua could check out Song Wat, and find our local favourites\r\nDua tried the famous plum tea (also bubble tea) in Singapore, so perhaps she\u2019s a keen coffee or tea drinker. Therefore, a trendy and storied street for Dua-Lipa-cafe-hopping is Song Wat, not too far from Chinatown. The classic to visit is definitely Song Wat Coffee & Roasters, though she may like FV BKK\u00a0 for its artsy interior, too.\r\nFood-wise, Song Wat is home to many local favourite restaurants, including Rong Klan Nuea for beef noodles, Urai for braised goose specialties, and one of our favourite all-round local Thai restaurants, Ega.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935246\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Jeh Oh Chula\/Facebook (left), @dualipa\/Instagram (right)[\/caption]\r\nNext up: Banthat Thong Road for the city\u2019s most famous tom yum soup, and what is set to become new Thai Street Food Central\r\nWe know Dua Lipa already tried laksa, so now it\u2019s time for tom yum. The most famous tom yum in the city is definitely found at Jeh Oh Chula, located on the street food haven that is Banthat Thong Road. Other highlights around here include Tek Heng Mee Krob for crispy noodles, Tang Sui Heng for claypot goose, and Elvis Suki, named after a fellow musician, for seafood sukiyaki.\r\nFor a tongue-in-cheek dessert, it\u2019s got to be 9\u201d Fried Banana, which sells 9-inch fried bananas with two scoops of ice cream. Yup.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935247\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: @dualipa\/Instagram (left), Jay Fai\/Facebook (right)[\/caption]\r\nJay Fai, for good measure (and for the world\u2019s most famous omelette)\r\nFollowing the slew of celebrities who have dined here before, this is the most obvious choice for Thai food Dua Lipa should try in Bangkok. Helmed by the amazing Jay Fai, Raan Jay Fai has been featured on Netflix, is long listed on Asia\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants, and has held a Michelin star since 2018. As a consequence, the queues to get a table at Jay Fai are long, but we have a feeling Dua Lipa could pull some strings.\r\nWhile she\u2019s here, she\u2019d be a fool to miss the famous crab omelette, as well as the dried congee, seafood drunken noodles (kee mao), and yellow curry.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935248\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Jok Prince\/Facebook (left), @dualipa\/Instagram (right)[\/caption]\r\nCharoenkrung for hidden gems, and Silom for Massaman curry and Indian food\r\nWe saw that Dua Lipa visited a Hindu temple in Singapore, so if she\u2019d like to follow a similar route in Bangkok, she could head to Silom\u2019s Pan Road to Sri Maha Mariamman Temple (Wat Kaek). Directly opposite, she would find Krua Aroy Aroy, which is often described as the best Massaman curry spot in Bangkok. Naturally, there are also a lot of good Indian restaurants in the area (we like Sri Ananda Bhawan best).\r\nA little further along in the creative district of Charoenkrung, Dua Lipa could indulge in a street art walk, and stop by Prachak for roasted duck, Jok Prince for the city\u2019s most classic congee, or Tuang Dimsum for dumplings. These spots are especially conveniently located if she\u2019s staying on the riverside.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935249\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: @dualipa\/Instagram (left), Phed Mark\/Facebook (right)[\/caption]\r\nOver in Ekkamai, Dua Lipa can test her spice tolerance (hotter than hell), get the famous fried rice, and sip 50-year-old broth\r\nEkkamai covers a large area of Bangkok, so this one requires some dedication, and some sitting in traffic. The most famous soup on this side of town can be found at Wattana Panich, a spot that has been cooking its beef broth with Chinese spices in the same pot for over 50 years. Over at Here Hai, Dua Lipa will find the most famous fried rice in town, packed with crab meat and a smoky aroma. Lastly, if she wants to test her spice tolerance, Phed Mark is the place to be. The brainchild of food vlogger Mark Wiens, they specialise in a very fiery pad krapow.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935250\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: @dualipa\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\nOn the weekend, it\u2019s off to Chatuchak, mostly for thrift shopping, but also some light snacking \r\nWe think Dua Lipa would love a thrift shop find, so Chatuchak Weekend Market is a must-visit. The largest weekend market in Thailand with over 15,000 stalls is both a labyrinth and a marvel, and we have a feeling Dua would enjoy the vintage selection, or even cheeky souvenir shopping. Food is more of an afterthought at Chatuchak, so we recommend this location for snacking and sipping on fresh fruit smoothies, coconut water and coconut ice cream, and more mainstream Thai street food dishes like pad Thai.\r\nSure, Dua Lipa has a concert in Mumbai on the Saturday after her Bangkok concert, but it is always suggested to visit Chatuchak in the morning, anyway. Nighttimes are for dancing the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935188\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: @dualipa\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\nAnywhere: Stop for Thai 7-11 snacks, like the famous toastie, sticky rice burger, and Thai milk tea\r\nIf the star doesn\u2019t feel like going out at all, we hope she can at least make time for our beloved 7-11 convenience store. The most famously popular item here is not a Thai dish, but rather the ham and cheese sandwich, toasted for you in the store. A simple search on TikTok unveils hundreds of videos on this phenomenon. One [search] is all it takes.\r\nA close second is the sticky rice burger, consisting of meat between two sticky rice \u2018patties.\u2019 To wash it down, Dua could get Thai milk tea from the machine, or whip up her signature Diet Coke, jalape\u00f1o, and pickle juice concoction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935251\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: @dualipa\/Instagram (left), Birdies\/Facebook (right)[\/caption]\r\nBonus: Not really street food, but if Dua Lipa is hit with another caviar craving in Bangkok, she could try Birdie\u2019s, Mott32, or CRU\r\nIt\u2019s pretty clear by now that Dua Lipa loves her caviar. Posting the delicacy on Instagram, we\u2019ve noticed that she often enjoys a good old bump on its own, or paired the classic way on a potato or blini. Whilst she could enjoy a fresh tin of Oscietra caviar at most fine dining venues in Bangkok, if she wants to get more adventurous, she could try fried chicken and caviar at Birdies, caviar with Peking duck at Mott32, or caviar inside cream cheese churros at CRU (also a champagne bar).\r\nIn case you missed it, Dua, Bangkok loves to eat well. We can\u2019t wait to have you.\r\nDua Lipa\u2019s Radical Optimism Tour concert will take place in Bangkok 27 November 2024.

Fortunately, the cravings for this iconic Sarawakian dish can be satisfied right here in KL and Selangor.\r\n\r\nThe challenge, however, is finding the real deal. Not all kolo mee are created equal, and it can be tricky to know which bowls are worth slurping up. That\u2019s where we come in. We\u2019ve done the hard work and assembled a list of the best spots serving up authentic Sarawak kolo mee, guaranteed to transport your taste buds straight to Kuching.\r\n\r\nFor those who aren\u2019t familiar with Sarawak kolo mee (firstly, where have you been?), it\u2019s the stuff noodle dreams are made of. In essence, kolo mee translates to \u5e72\u635e\u9762, or dry mixed noodles. Unlike the more familiar wan tan mee, which tends to swim in dark soy sauce, kolo mee is all about simplicity and balance. It's usually topped with generous helpings of minced meat and mixed with a sinful amount of pork lard and char siew. This gives it that satisfying springy texture that\u2019s practically begging you to dig in.\r\n\r\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker \u2013 kolo mee comes in two equally delicious variations. There\u2019s the white version, which has a clean, pure flavour, and the red version, which ups the indulgence factor with the addition of char siew oil, making it slightly sweeter (and yes, slightly more sinful). It\u2019s the kind of dish that makes you feel like you should call your trainer and apologise, but you don\u2019t care because it\u2019s just that good.\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re a Sarawakian feeling a little homesick or a West Malaysian in search of new foodie adventures, these kolo mee joints in KL and Selangor are the next best thing to hopping on a plane to Sarawak.\r\n\r\n(Hero and feature images credit: Instagram\/ @kuailefeizhai_hf)\r\nSatisfy your Sarawak kolo mee fix by visiting these best spots in KL and Selangor\r\n"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"The best new cafes in Bangkok right now","position":18,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/dining\/best-new-cafes-in-bangkok-2024\/","description":"Whether you\u2019re caffeine enthusiasts or matcha culture aficionados, Bangkok is constantly churning out an inexhaustible lineup of new cafes.

We recommend going earlier to catch the natural sun, and bring a friend or two to share the cuteness overload.\r\n\r\nWhat we're ordering: Their signature bear bread with butter and jam is a must, although the mini bear cakes churn out the buttery goodness a proper bear needs. For drinks, the iced cold brew or cold brew with tonic lemonade will surely hit the spot, or if you want a non-coffee option, their homemade honey lemonade or the apple tea are superb choices.\r\n\r\nMore info: Bubbibear Cafe\r\nOpening times: Open daily, 10am-6pm\r\nLocation: 502\/361 Thanon Asok - Din Daeng, Din Daeng, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Rama 9, MRT\r\nGoogle review: 4.9\/5\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935013\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1080\"] Image credit: leek.coffee\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\nLeek\r\nLeek is born out of simplicity \u2014 out of the goal to not think too much while serving up hearty homebaked goods with coffee and nothing less. That's how the name is as simple as it can be, how everything seems minimal and sleek, but it never feels lacking nor boring. Although this new cafe is located far down Sukhumvit, it makes for a great pitstop when in the area.\r\n\r\nWhat we're ordering: Both coffee and pastry selections regularly rotate, because they want to showcase small, local roasteries in Thailand. We'd say ask for recommendations when it comes to coffee, and grab one of their cakes to pair. The Basque cheesecake is well-crafted, and the orange olive oil cake is a fun treat for any time of the day.\r\n\r\nMore info: Leek\r\nOpening times: Mon-Sat, 8am-5pm\r\nLocation: 301\/25 Soi Pridi Banomyong 42, Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Phra Khanong, BTS\r\nGoogle review: 5\/5\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935017\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1080\"] Image credit: overdote.cafe\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\nOverdote Cafe\r\nLevel up your brunch game at Overdote.

Come a little hungry, because their dishes are also must-tries. Plus, they're pet-friendly, so bring your pals along for a playdate.\r\n\r\nWhat we're ordering: Look for their take on an Espresso Martini \u2014 all the good stuff without the alcohol, and added notes of basil and vanilla. They also do a frappucino with chestnut foam that melts in your mouth. For food, their Jerusalem artichoke soup will have you in am arti-chokehold, and the smoked duck ciabatta will leave you wanting more.\r\n\r\nMore info: Overdote Cafe\r\nOpening times: Open daily, 7am-5pm\r\nLocation: W District, 1595, 500 Sukhumvit Rd, Phra Khanong Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Phra Khanong, BTS\r\nGoogle review: 5\/5\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935018\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1080\"] Image credit: cloudtea.bkk\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\nCloud Tea\r\nThai people take their iced tea very seriously, and Cloud Tea is the perfect addition to the Ari-Saphan Kwai area that will surely stay a while. Of course, boba milk tea is a must, but this new spot specialises in fruits and pairing them with tea. As it's open air, the place is also pet-friendly.\r\n\r\nWhat we're ordering: Their signature drinks pair passionfruit with earl grey, apple with osmanthus, orange with jasmine tea, and more, but those who want to really feel the hit of tea can also order their selection of fresh teas and milk teas.\r\n\r\nMore info: Cloud Tea\r\nOpening times: Open daily, 9am-7pm\r\nLocation: 11 Phahon Yothin 14, Samsen Nai, Phaya Thai, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Ari, BTS\r\nGoogle review: 5\/5\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935019\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1080\"] Image credit: Jerome Cheesecake Thailand[\/caption]\r\nJerome Cheesecake @ICONSIAM\r\nJerome Cheesecake has been open in Thailand for some time, but their new launch features their first-ever flagship store outside of Japan, located in ICONSIAM.

As those words are used more liberally outside of France, in this case, it just means they sell both pastries and bread. Nonetheless, they're great pastries and bread baked with care. With a vinyl player on the premise and warm-toned interiors, the place makes for great morning pick-me-ups, or to lay back with a book of choice.\r\n\r\nWhat we're ordering: They're aiming to change the coffee and baked goods menus monthly, which adds to the excitement if you're a regular.

Our favourite flavours include Milo, Honey Stars, pink milk with Jollybears, and mixed fruit-flavoured Dutch Mill with Fruit Loops.

Following a glorious opening party mid-September, expect this to be the season\u2019s hottest reservation.\r\nThe food: Those who are familiar with Nobu will know that the signature menu fuses together traditional Japanese ingredients and techniques with Peruvian flavours. Must-try highlights from Chef Nobu Matsuhisa\u2019s menu include the Black Cod Miso, Yellowtail Jalape\u00f1o, and Toro Tartare.

Expect Cantonese and Chiu Chow flavours presented in innovative ways, with a few of our favourites including the Chilled Whole Squid with Green Sichuan Peppercorn, Smoked and Pickled Duck Tongue, Black Sugar Vinegar Iberico Pork, and K\u2019s Signature Crab with Chinese Black Olive and Garlic.

At Le Du Kaan, we are impressed by a menu that manages to encompass all main regions of Thailand, using only locally-sourced ingredients. Thereby, classic flavours sneak up on you in creative ways, be it in the Gang Som Cha Om Goong (marinated banana prawn in gaeng som sauce), Aom Gai (fermented fish soup with chicken mousse ravioli), Krapow Nuer (Holy Basil fried rice with braised Thai Tajima wagyu), or Lin Yang (Thai Tajima wagyu tongue). Regulars at Chef Ton\u2019s other restaurants need not fear: the beloved grilled river prawn is also available here. Contrary to how it may seem, we particular love that Le Du Kaan\u2019s menu is extremely price-friendly, too.\r\nThe vibes: We have a feeling that Le Du Kaan\u2019s outdoor bar and seating area is going to be the most popular in town, especially once the weather cools. The photo opps are endless at Le Du Kaan, and the interiors strike a balance between subtle Thai touches and worldly elegance. Despite its large size, it is unpretentiously approachable.

Nothing Sacred has opened on the outskirts of Chinatown to bring you just that.\r\nThe food: Nothing Sacred is the brain child of Canadian couple Alex Jarvis and Nicole Scott, and serves as an \"experimental chef\u2019s counter and sound lab.\" Mention of the menu cannot come without mention of the music, as Chef Alex is also a two-time Grammy Award-winning producer. As he presents his house-made fermentations and mirins to pair with a seafood-forward menu, a carefully-curated playlist flows between courses. Highlights include Short Rib & Squid, Spotted Grouper with Bamboo and Sweet Corn, and the delicious Congee Tart. The house-made kombucha selection is also worth trying.\r\nThe vibes: Dining at Nothing Sacred is very much an experience. Guest are enveloped in a kind of trance, as the symphony unfolds and the meal begins. There is little explanation beyond ingredients for every course, and due to its small size, conversation between diners remains intimate. For the eyes, we love the local art that you can find at Nothing Sacred \u2014 as if on a quiet treasure hunt \u2014 from the bathroom to the main dining area.\r\nNothing Sacred, 188 Chaokhamrop Road, Pom Prep, Sattru Phai, Bangkok, +66 64 926 3618. \r\n\r\nNew menus in Bangkok this October\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1932205\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Canvas[\/caption]\r\nCanvas brings the \u2018Oomph\u2019 in their new menu\r\nIt\u2019s always a fun time at Canvas, and this season, Chef Riley Sanders is set to keep you there for the whole evening. \u2018Oomph\u2019 is comprised of 28 courses in an exciting new menu, finding a balance between big flavours and minimalist presentation.

The restaurant boasts a contemporary ambience, with a monochromatic colour palette contrasted with warm tones and leather furniture.\r\nThe food:\u00a0Japanese food done right with quality ingredients we crave. The yellowtail with yuzu dressing is light and refreshing. The prawn tempura is crazy crunchy. The A3 Oguma beef striploin is bursting with flavours. It's a great time from start to\u00a0finish.

This June, we see the arrival of the summer menu, featuring 19 dishes in a sharing experience.\r\nThe food: There is an overall sense of joy in IGNIV\u2019s summer menu, subtly underpinned by smoky flavour notes, inducing a charming air of summer barbecue. This is more obvious in highlight dishes such as the Wagyu short ribs with salsa verde and \u201cGrillgem\u00fcse\u201d (catch Chef David Hartwig pronouncing this in Swiss German as he explains), but also elegantly achieved through the char in the eggplant dish or the wildly surprising lettuce sorbet \u201ccornetto.\u201d For seafood lovers, the combination of langoustine in various forms alongside fresh fruit and vegetables is a refreshing nod to an outdoor garden party. New and noteworthy is also the signature Chicken Nuggets as a sumptuous menu add-on for IGNIV regulars. Back due to popular demand, these come with a full tin of German caviar for the ultimate summertime indulgence.\r\nThe IGNIV Summer Menu is available from June until August 2024.

It\u2019s as playfully experimental as we always know them to be, and the new dishes showcase familiar ingredients in a fun light.\r\nThe food: Start with the snacks and try the Duck Waffle with duck foie gras mousse, duck confit and prune sauce (THB 390), before exploring the colourful starter selection. There\u2019s a bright pink Grilled Beet Salad (THB 450), or even the cured Yellow Tail with avocado (THB 720) if you seek something a little lighter. Regulars can rest assured that the Cold Capellini (THB 450) is still present on the main menu, though we particularly enjoyed the super tender slow-cooked short ribs with smoked cheese (THB 980), and the White Asparagus Cacio e Pepe (THB 680) for a cheesy-delicious take on the European summer staple veg. Looking for something healthy and wholesome? We highly recommend the Salmon Kimchi Broth (THB 560) with white miso, yuzu cosh, cucumber, shimeji, and wakame. As a pro tip, definitely have a chat with the bartender for some worthy cocktails to pair.\u00a0\r\nOcken, Building A, Bhiraj Tower at Sathon, 31 S Sathon Rd, Yan Nawa, Sathon, Bangkok, +66 080 273 3220.

It is available for lunch and dinner, and perfect with some good company.\r\nThe food: Anything that feels refreshing and fun makes a good start to any meal. The chu toro with chili ponzu (THB 980) has a little spice kick and a big yuzu uppercut. The salt-grilled sea bass fillet (THB 920) features insanely crispy skin and a smokiness from the robata grill.

Helmed by culinary storyteller and chef-owner Rohit Sharma, the interiors offer plenty for diners to admire, from the geometric Warli art patterns to the Bastar tribal motifs, and the gorgeous 32-foot long Kerala-inspired oil canvas. There\u2019s even a hand-cut mirror mosaic of a peacock by the stairs.\u00a0\r\nThe food: Tapori has really and truly managed to set itself apart from the crowd and stands out for its bold and genuinely interesting flavours. Showcasing India\u2019s lesser-known dishes, diners can explore the map at the beginning of the menu, and try favourites and hidden gems from each region. We loved the spicy and crunchy Wahan Mosdeng (pork salad from Tripura), the Gobhi Mussallam (grilled cauliflower), the fun Sindhi Dal Pakwan (\u201ca Sindhi brunch masterpiece\u201d), and the intriguing Tawa-Masala Kaleji Ice Cream (made with chicken liver!). The menu is vast and worthy of many revisits to retry, though unmissable is definitely the Benami Kheer dessert. Hailing from the royal kitchens of Awadh, it is made with a secret ingredient all diners are invited to guess.

Focusing on live fires and charcoal \u2014 the smokiness that enhances the dish \u2014 the tasting menu highlights Thai ingredients and the culture that surrounds them. Locals will find the experience warm and comforting, and the visiting locals will definitely have their interests piqued.\r\nThe vibes: Located on the ground floor of NYSA Hotel in Sukhumvit 13, it feels a quite serene to dine in Kwann \u2014 like a corner tucked away from all the chaos of the area. As the venue is quite spacious, it's perfect to dine with your preferred company because of how intimate it feels. The open kitchen in full view also adds a touch of connection between diners and all the action.\r\nThe food: \"Kwann\" is translated directly to \"smoke,\" so you'd expect their proteins to be on point, and they certainly do not disappoint. The wagyu beef tongue nam-tok is aromatic and refreshing \u2014 a punch greatly welcomed as a start to the meal. What diners should look forward to is the sharing-style main course. Grilled duck in Hoisin sauce, grilled mushroom nam prik, and more; not only do they taste amazing, the portions are very generous. That alone evokes a sense of swapping plates around the table and sharing, as if you're sitting at a homey Thai dining table.\r\nKwann, 73\/7-8, Soi Sukhumvit 13, Khwaeng Khlong Toei Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok.

Just like at their previous pop-up, your chance of booking their special bowl of ramen is nigh to zero\u2013the rumours have it that they\u2019re already fully booked until the end of May.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe food: Rotated and changed every two months, Kataru stays true to its ever-evolving craft, unveiling 2-3 menus featuring relatively unconventional approaches to ramen.

It\u2019s about simple, good Italian food done right with no need for superficially sparkling sprinkles on top.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe food: We loved the Hamachi Crudo (THB550), consisting of thinly sliced hamachi (Japanese amberjack) seasoned with yuzu, lemon, and a slight touch of pungent wasabi. Another commendable dish was the Black Truffle Ravioli (THB 980) which oozes out fresh egg yolk blended with truffle and pecorino cheese. What we really liked, however, was their simple Chocolate Mousse (THB380), served alongside vanilla gelato\u2013the salt flakes sprinkled on top provide a good respite from making the dish become too sweet.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCento Bangkok. 120 Saladaeng Soi 1.

For those who may be new to the scene, Enishi Ramen, despite its Japanese origin, was relatively under the radar back in its hometown. When the ramen chain branched out to Singapore\u2019s International Plaza, however, Enishi Ramen has won over ramen lovers there with their dashi-based broth and its famous \u2018Dan Dan Ramen,\u2019 which warranted them the Michelin\u2019s Bib Gourmand recognition.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe vibe: Think of the wooden counter bar typically found in Japanese ramen spots, with only 10 seats available. The queue may not be as scary and disheartening as what it may have been for most of the buzzed spots back in the days, but you still need to brace yourself for long waiting lists during the evening.\r\n\r\nThe food: Ramen aficionados may know how ubiquitous the tonkotsu (pork bone) broth is when it comes to the Japanese noodle scene.

Say no more as the team behind the beloved Indian restaurant Indus has unveiled their new snazzy spot Jharokha at Erawan Building.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe vibe: Jharokha translates to \u201cwindow,\u201d in reference to the ornately carved windows of the Rajasthani palaces.

A central bar welcomes guests into the restaurant, before you enter into the mirrored dining hall with views of bustling Chidlom just outside.\r\n\r\nThe food: Jharokha\u2019s menu draws its inspiration from the fireside cooking traditions of the Indian royals, who, after going hunting, would gather around open flames to enjoy the fruit of their conquests.

They do great noodles and fried rice, but where they shine the most is certainly their dim sum.

There\u2019s also outdoor seating available when PM2.5 is kind enough to let you dine outside.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe food: While the menu stays largely the same\u2013think their Chicken & Waffles (THB480), Cured Beef Tongue & Mash, and AFR Fried Combo (featuring bacon from Phrom Phong\u2019s breakfast spot Larder)\u2013Chalee Kader tells us the future additions will see more Italian-American offerings.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor more information, contact Mickey\u2019s Diner.\u00a0\r\nKorea's No.1 fried chicken BHC has landed in centralwOrld\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a die-hard fan of everything Korean, then you have probably heard of or dined at BHC Chicken during your pilgrimage to South Korea. While travelling to Korea has become such an onerous task for Thais\u2013particularly due to their recent fiasco on screening tourists from phee noi (a cute slang for illegal workers: Casper)\u2013you can now enjoy BHC\u2019s finger-licking good chicken at centralwOrld without fear of getting deported.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe vibe: Bright yellow, with adorable neon lighting and an LCD screen that repetitively teases you with their golden crispy fried chicken.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe food: Living up to its name \u201cBetter Happier Choice,\u201d BHC offers a slightly healthier option to your usual crunchy fried delicacies thanks to their use of high oleic sunflower oil. Try their Bburinkle Chicken (starting at THB189), a crispy fried chicken coated with a cheese, garlic, and onion dust. Those who can\u2019t get enough of their Bburing can opt for their crispy cheese balls (THB199). Since it\u2019s also their first Thailand outpost, BHC also presents country-exclusive menus\u2013think the crispy chicken skin (THB159) sprinkled with Bburingkle and American Fried Rice (THB249).\r\n\r\nFor more information, contact BHC Chicken Thailand.\u00a0\r\nNagoya\u2019s eel specialist \u2018Unagi Yondaime Kikukawa\u2019 opens its first Thailand outpost at Emquartier\r\n\r\n\r\nBangkok may have already been full with Japanese eel specialists, but with Nagoya's eel expert Unagi Yondaime Kikukawa opening in Emquartier, the scene could get, well, a little bit more competitive. Long established since 1912, this eel specialist boasts an astonishingly long history of over 112 years and is under the helm of its yondaime (fourth generation) owner Yohei who has been trained under his family since he was 12. Now, the restaurant has brought its first outpost to Thailand, opening on Emquartier's 6th floor.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe vibe: As minimal and functional as it may get, Unagi Yondaime Kikukawa Thailand is one of those places that let the dishes speak for themselves. The best part? You can see them catching eel live and grilling them on the spot.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe food: Order their hitsumabashi set (THB940), a thinly sliced grilled unagi placed over rice served with a bowl of clear soup, for which you can add to the dish to enjoy it with a variety of flavours. They also have smaller and more affordable sets, such as the premium unagi set for THB620.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor more information, contact Unagi Yondaime Kikukawa Thailand.\r\nKokugara Ramen is your new go-to spot for ramen in Ari\r\n\r\n\r\nAri may be many things, but spots for ramen may not be one of them. With this new ramen-slash-izakaya spot hidden above White Cloud Building in Ari Soi 7, however, this could be a game changer for Ari\u2019s ramen culture.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe vibe: Situated on the 7th floor of White Cloud Building, the place may not look far different from other ramen spots with its wooden counter bar and some stand-alone seating, but the venue will transform into a drinking spot for wine, sake, and gin lovers by night.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe food: While we haven't paid our personal visit to the place yet, several of our friends who are way more seasoned and experienced in Bangkok\u2019s ramen scene all unanimously praise all of their ramen offerings here. Their current menu sees Gyokai Tonkotsu Ramen Special (THB399), featuring a rich, opulent broth of pork bone and seafood dashi; and Ika Sumi Tsukemen served alongside the black squid sauce and three slices of pork chashu.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor more information, contact Kokugara Ramen\r\n\u00a0The culinary sandbox Napha Chef opens its flagship store in Emsphere\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a group of esteemed chefs\u2013Thaninthorn \u201cNoom\u201d Chatrawan, Kamol \u201cGigg\u201d Chobdee-ngam, Namthip \u201cJah\u201d Poosri, Kongwuth \u201cKong\u201d Chaiwongkachon, Vijjuda \u201cNamchuem\u201d Sumpantaworaboot, Pruek Sumpantaworaboot, and Penny Jirayuwatan\u2013realised they could join hands to support one another in their pursue of culinary creations, they collectively kickstarted the culinary space Napha Chefs in 2022, promising tasty yet affordable delicacies. Two years passed since then, and they have finally unveiled their first flagship store on the GM floor of the bustling Emsphere.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe vibe: It's mall dining, yes, but the vibe is relatively warm and inviting, boasting some intricate design works with patterned walls and antique-looking wooden furniture that is judiciously blended in with the space.\r\n\r\nThe food: The menu, which showcases specialisations from each chef, encompasses recipes from all four regions of Thai cuisine. There's the traditional roasted pork with egg noodles, deep-fried snow fish with palo sauce, stewed beef khao soi, and Northeastern platter of phakao, which sees a firewood-smoked pork sausage, fried chicken, pork rind, and shrimp jaew sauce.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor more information, contact Napha Chefs.\u00a0\r\nPaii launches \u2018The Experience\u2019 as a journey through modern Thai seafood\r\n\r\nKnown for its innovative take on modern Thai seafood, Paii has recently launched \u2018The Experience\u2019 as a special set menu within its gorgeous House on Sathorn venue.\u00a0\r\nThe vibe: It\u2019s always a vibrant affair at Paii, and with its new set menu option, diners are presented a fantastic snapshot of their culinary highlights.

Amongst many others, these include Choo Chee lobster, scallop Pad Phong Kari, and Chef Joe Weeraket\u2019s beloved crab fried rice. Don\u2019t miss the \u201cThai-tearamisu\u201d and lemongrass panna cotta dessert, ending the meal on a lightly sweet and charmingly Thai note.\u00a0\r\nThe \u2018Paii The Experience\u2019 menu is priced at THB 3500++ per person.

Mall dining is often met with eye rolls, mostly from everyone, whether it\u2019s because of the dull, soul-draining decor or the sheer number of crowds passing by. However, at Bread Street Kitchen, the venue may make you forget that you\u2019re dining inside a mall, with its industrial-warehouse vibe and open kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhy go? While the hype for his Beef Wellington was justified, the prices and portions made us reluctant to say we\u2019ll definitely go back for it\u2013think THB3,900\/set and a massive size enough to feed 5 people. Still, we loved the Sticky Date Toffee Pudding. Should the crowd thin out a bit, you might spot us booking a table just for this dessert plate.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information at Bread Street Kitchen & Bar.\r\nCasa Lenzi is bringing hearty, no-nonsense Italian dishes to Thonglor\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mastermind behind Bangkok\u2019s crowd-favourite Italian restaurants\u2013Lenzi Tuscan Kitchen and Nonna Nella\u2013chef Francesco Lenzi has expanded his repertoire to Thonglor with his new Italian establishment Casa Lenzi.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat's the vibe? Tucked away inside Phrom Sri Soi 2, his new spot is a timeless-yet-modern space, with its exposed stone-brick facade and chic arched window from the outside. Once stepping inside, however, you\u2019ll see the crystal chandeliers, tufted leather seats, and an occasional splash of colour here and there from abstract paintings on the walls.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhy go? Chef Lenzi is known for his use of great produce and unparalleled techniques, sourcing his high-quality ingredients from his family farm in Tuscany. The main draw is undoubtedly his wood-fire grilled creations\u2013think the Grilled Tasmanian Grass-fed Lamb Chop (THB1,280) served with carrot puree and roasted leek and 270-days grain-fed Australian Angus beef tenderloin paired with a fresh heap of rocket salad and cherry tomatoes and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (THB1,400).\r\n\r\nYou can find more information at Casa Lenzi.\r\nThe little sister of Bangkok\u2019s cool khao gaeng spot, Charmkrung opens in Charoenkrung\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nNot to be confused with Iberry Group\u2019s upscale mall khao gaeng, Charmgang has been garnering a loyal fanbase ever since its opening in 2019 with its authentically tasty Thai curry offerings. In December last year, the mastermind behind this trendy curry spot Aruss \u201cJai\u201d Lerlerstkul launched a sister branch called Charmkrung, just a stone\u2019s throw away from the OG spot.\r\n\r\nWhat's the vibe? Situated on the 6th floor of an old building in Charoenkrung Soi 31, this new little sister is an ideal spot for those who are looking for a laid-back, cozy atmosphere with a view overlooking Charoenkrung\u2019s bustling streets. Head there before 5.30pm and sit by the window to bathe yourself in the sunset.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhy go? Charmgang is already synonymous with good food, and its food offerings are always a joy to read. Start from hoy kor lae (THB220), the Southern-style grilled curried mussels, and Charmkrung\u2019s liver pate (THB220) with chives served in Thai pancakes, kanom krok. Equally intriguing is their Massaman curry (THB590), featuring a tender chunk of beef cheek served with raisin roti sheets. There\u2019s also a special late-night menu where you can order their braised beef cheek soup with rice for THB490.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou can find more information at Charmkrung.\r\nMezze is Bangkok\u2019s latest addition to the Lebanese cuisine scene\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine what\u2019s not to love about Lebanese cuisine\u2013the spice-kicked meat skewers, the crunch from deep-fried falafels, or that silky, smooth bowl of hummus. Who wouldn\u2019t love that? The city may have its Lebanese mainstays\u2013think Rawabina, Beirut, Al Khayma, and Al Saray\u2013all of which boast the level of authenticity and richness of the cuisine. Here, at Mezze, not only will you get a homey, traditional style done right, you can also indulge in a more playful and younger take on Lebanese cuisine as well.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat's the vibe? Stepping inside Mezze, situated on the second floor of a shophouse in Sukhumvit Soi 16, would give you an impression that you were walking into a cafe\u2013with its light wood accents, abundance of natural light, and eye-popping blue color palette.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhy go? Their grilled halloumi cheese and tomato (THB175) was truly a showstopper with its pomegranate molasse complementing the grilled cheese skewers quite well. On our last visit, we saw that there was also a halloumi cheese salad (THB245) which featured a larger portion of the grilled cheese, and wished we could have exchanged the skewers for that one instead. There\u2019s also a creativity to be admired for their lamb kofta ragu (THB235), featuring minced lamb and pecorino cheese\u2013though be warned that the dish leans towards the salty side. Their baklava (THB155) is unmissable.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information at Mezze\r\nSushi Kuuya is set to be another buzz spot for sushi omakase in Langsuan this year\r\n\r\n\r\nLangsuan has welcomed a new sushi omakase to the hood. Honing his skills at the Michelin-starred restaurants in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, chef Goji Kobayashi may be a familiar face to those frequenting the Pullman Hotel. At his new outpost, Sushi Kuuya, chef Kobayashi makes his sushi in the Edomae style in his winter menu (THB4,500), utilising his custom-made stove, lending a more precise control of temperature and consistency of the rice used in each dish. Some of the highlights include his anago (salt-water eel), which Kobayashi gently simmers for 60 minutes, tenderising the meat before grilling it to give it that crisp exterior.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou can find more information at Sushi Kuuya\r\nEl Santo transports you to Mexico with its lucha-libre theme, and lots of mezcal and tequila\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people behind Soho Hospitality Group\u2013the masterminds behind places like Above Eleven, Havana Social, and Yankii Robatayaki\u2013have brought out their newest outpost, and this time, it\u2019s a Mexican restaurant with masked wrestler themes, opening this 8 January.\r\n\r\nWhat's the vibe? We're not sure if it\u2019s just us, but El Santo does remind us of Cartoon Network\u2019s old series \u00a1Mucha Lucha! with its painted murals of renowned wrestlers like Rey Mysterio and the ring-robe similar to those used in the real stadium.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhy go? Chef Daniel Calderon Camacho whips up some of the most unapologetically authentic Mexican food in dishes like Panuchos de Cochinita Pibil, featuring fresh bean-stuffed tortilla with marinated pork, and Aguachile Verde, a spicy shrimp ceviche. The place also boasts over 65 labels of mezcal and tequila in its arsenal, so you can make liberal use of these the next time you go out with your peers.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou can find more information at El Santo\r\nNew menus and other dining news in Bangkok this January 2024\r\nDen Kushi Flori's new winter menu showcases bold fusion flavours done right\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Khai Kai with chicken yakitori and tamarind-almond senbei; scallop mousse jiggling with soy milk pudding and winter truffle; duck meat skewer with bok choy puree; and confit beef tongue with 'khao mok kai'\u00a0sauce\u2013these are chef Susumu Shimizu's take on his new winter menu which showcases his French and Japanese culinary techniques while infusing elements that are essentially Thai. But that's not all, this upcoming 14 January, chef Zaiyu Hasegawa from Den and chef Hiroyasu Kawate from Florilege are joining Shimizu for an exclusive collaboration, too.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information at Den Kushi Flori Bangkok.\r\nGinza Tenharu launches its new winter menu with Edo-style tempura\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's always a satisfying crunch when it comes to tempura, but what's better than your regular deep-fried delicacy? It's the tempura omakase where you can indulge in some of the most highly-prized produce fried to golden perfection. Since 2018, Ginza Tenharu has been captivating Bangkok's taste buds with its meticulously deep-fried Edo-style tempura, and for its new winter menu, the seasonal selection sees some of the finest seasonal ingredients, such as\u00a0tarabagani (king crab), madara (Japanese cod fish), and kaki (oyster) imported directly from Japan's renowned Toyosu Market, the largest fish market in the country.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information at Ginza Tenharu Bangkok.\r\nR-Haan's new winter menu showcases Thailand's best seasonal produce, while steering towards sustainability\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes we've almost lost count of how many years R-Haan has been awarded two Michelin stars\u2013it's been five years in case you've forgotten. To celebrate its fifth anniversary of receiving two stars, the Thai fine dining establishment has launched a winter menu, showcasing Thailand's seasonal produce while steering towards sustainability. Some of the highlights include the delectable starter, formed into an axe-shape Thailand map, which allows you to take a pilgrimage across all regions of Thailand, from the grilled northern pork sausage topped with nam prik num\u00a0and Udon Thani's duck salad served with heaps of herb, to the sweet and sour crispy rice vermicelli topped with caviar sourced from Thailand's Royal Project, and southern-style spicy rice salad featuring Thai mackerel with Sai Buri's fermented fish sauce.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information at R-Haan."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"12 best rooftop restaurants in Bangkok to dine with a view","position":20,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/dining\/food\/best-rooftop-restaurants-in-bangkok-to-dine-with-a-view\/","description":"In a city with such a hot climate, a chill breeze running through your hair as you dine is such a vibe.

Knowing where to drink is key, and we have just what you need. Here are the best bars in Bangkok this month.\r\n\r\n[Hero and featured image credit: Vesper]\r\nThe best new bars and cocktail menus in Bangkok this November 2024\r\nUnlike the math equation from the 2004 movie, the limit does exist. If your body can take so much alcohol in one night, those drinks better be so good, and boy, do we have the places for that. Tis' the season of new cocktail menus, and we're here for all of them. Our entries are tried and true.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a trip through the world's capitals with Rabbit Hole's crossword-themed menu\r\nThonglor's staple Rabbit Hole has never played it safe when it comes to cocktails. Their alphabet-themed cocktail menu won the \"Best Menu Design of the Year\" in last year's Thailand\u2019s 20 Best Bars list, and this menu can be seen as sort of a continuation or evolution of how the team translates unconventional ingredients into cocktails.\r\n\r\nWith a crossword-themed menu, it seems down the Rabbit Hole takes you to 16 different capitals from all over the world, translated into liquid form. Their savoury-but-approachable flavours work because the balance is just right. \"Beijing\" is made by fat-washing bourbon with duck oil, and pairing it with hoisin sauce, five-spice, and plum wine. \"Lisbon\" is their take on an egg tart with salted butter and egg custard sugar. \"Canberra\" is a gin-based tall drink with truffle oil, grape vinegar, and a hint of vegemite (it really works).\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0Rabbit Hole\r\nOpening times: Open daily, 7pm-2am\r\nLocation: 125 Thong Lo, Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Thonglor, BTS\r\n\r\n\r\nVesper launches the third edition of their 'People of Vesper' menu\r\nA decade ago, Vesper opened its doors. Countless visitors have walked through that door over the past 10 years, and many find themselves back again and again. That is what the 'People of Vesper' menus have been celebrating: the wonderful people they have been welcoming, from local friends to international industry colleagues. Now in its third rendition, the team came up with 16 new signature cocktails paying homage to the people on the opposite side of the bar, with four sections depending on what style of drinks you prefer.\r\n\r\nHighlights include the \"Machiya Sour,\" featuring two whiskies, kokuto (Okinawan black sugar) liqueur, and umeshu, served with a glass of yuzu lapsang sparkling wine, the \"Pinkball,\" a highball-style drink with tequila, mezcal with notes of rhubarb and rooibos, as well as their take on the \"Whisky Coke Float,\" featuring housemade cola and bourbon poured over ice cream made from condensed milk, coffee beans, vanilla, and Guinness.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0Vesper\r\nOpening times: Open daily, 5.30pm-2am\r\nLocation: 10\/15 Sala Daeng 2 Alley, Si Lom, Bang Rak, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Silom, MRT; Sala Daeng, BTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSESSION.BKK is Sanam Pao's newest obsession with interesting drinks and great atmosphere\r\nBorn from a group of people that simply love spirits, and the little nuances each of them differ from each other, comes a cocktail bar that is filled to the brim with liquors and liqueurs from the owners' adventures. Whether you're looking for something on the rocks, enjoyed neat, or in a cocktail, let them recommend something that will leave a smile on your face till you have to leave. The simple, sleek bar interior works wonders in contrast with the view of the sky train outside, and be sure to keep their food menus in mind for when you're feeling peckish.\r\n\r\nIt's quite a bold move to do a cocktail menu with half being on the spirit-forward side, but it aligns with how much they appreciate the world of liquors and trying to showcase the best of them. Highlights include the \"Smooth Operator\" that had us moving from coast to coast, LA to Chicago, with Naked Malt whisky, Buffalo Trace bourbon, and Glendalough Irish whisky all in one glass, the \"Casked Negroni\" starring Gil (smoked gin from Italy) and Starlino Rosso vermouth, as well as the \"Mozart's Dream,\" a very fun cocktail with brandy and rum, along with notes of coconut and vanilla.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0OBSESSION.BKK\r\nOpening times: Tue-Sun, 6.30pm-1am (until 1.30am on Fri-Sat)\r\nLocation: 4th Floor, The Rock Pub, 1011-3\/4 Phahonyothin Rd, Phaya Thai, Khet Phaya Thai, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Sanam Pao, BTS\r\n\r\n\r\nRogue Affair presents a brand-new cocktail menu inspired by John Wick\r\nSilom's Rogue Affair is themed around the concept of espionage, with dimly-lit atmosphere contrasted by red glows from behind the bar and a big poker mat fully playable for the guests. Their new menu, \"The Continental,\" is inspired by everyone's favourite hitman and notable dog person, John Wick. For when you're executing missions and looping in on your targets, a drink in hand will definitely help to blend into the crowd.\r\n\r\nHighlights include \"The Excommunicado,\" with melon-infused brandy, grilled corn-infused port wine, and served with parmesan cheese, \"The Casablanca,\" a tropical-style cocktail with notes of herbal tea and papaya, as well as \"The Wife,\" a riff on the classic cocktail Rosita (think Negroni with tequila), made by fat-washing tequila with coconut, infusing vermouth with jackfruit, and garnishing with a piece of jackfruit on top.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0Rogue Affair\r\nOpening times: Tue-Sun, 6pm-1am\r\nLocation: 63 Sala Daeng 2 Alley, Silom, Bang Rak, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Sala Daeng, BTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMurMur bar presents fun new creations \"From Our Lab\"\r\nAt this point, the MurMur feels akin to an evening community space with lively, welcoming folks both in front and behind the bar. In a quite unlikely location such as Samsen road, it makes it even more heartwarming how they keep experimenting new things not to only pursue their own passions, but as a response to those who walk through their door. That is the beginning of their new menu \"From Our Lab,\" that looks simple at first glance, but is packed with flavours and feels complex.\r\n\r\nHighlights include the definitely-soon-to-be crowd favourite \"Spiced Chocolate,\" made by infusing tequila with bird's eye chili, and pairing it with almond milk and a punch of cacao, their take on the \"Tom Kha\" using kaffir lime, fresh lemongrass, galangal, and more, that feels fun and refreshing without feeling like drinking a mouthful of broth, as well as the \"Peanut Butter & Pandan Old Fashioned\" with flavours true to its name, and nothing less.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0MurMur\r\nOpening times: Open daily, 6pm-1am (until 2am from Fri-Sat)\r\nLocation: 59, 61 Samsen Rd, Wat Sam Phraya, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Sam Yot, MRT\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1934765\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1668\"] Image credit: APT 101[\/caption]\r\nAPT 101 is a nightclub with the vibes of a 1970s New York penthouse\r\nInspired by the lifestyles of fashion icons of 1970s New York, APT 101 is a place to dance, to drink, socalise, entertain, and everything in between. Even though the 1970s are known for economic hardship and rampant crimes, this nightclub chooses to instead reimagine the bustling art and nightlife movements that impact the world until today. As a fun twist, it seems they also decided to play a combination of house music, R&B, and hip-hop, although any references to disco fever that was born in the 1970s are nowhere in sight. We suppose the disco ball is just for decor.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0APT 101\r\nOpening times: Thu-Mon, 6pm-midnight\r\nLocation: 3rd Floor, 233 Sukhumvit Rd, Khwaeng Khlong Toei Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Asoke, BTS\r\nThe best new bars and cocktail menus in Bangkok this October 2024\r\nWe're surprised there are still new places to drink in Bangkok every month, and we still fully welcome it. The city is thriving, and people are looking to experiment with new things and have fun while doing so. These new bars and cocktail menus will surely help you find a new spot to hang out, be it solo or with some good company.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessengerservice moves to Chinatown, complete with a grocery-themed menu\r\nBefore Bar Us, there was Messengerservice. Formerly of Pattanakarn area, they had found a new home in Chinatown area, tucked inside a beautiful 100-year-old building called Baan Trok Tua Ngork. It's the clean, crisp flavours and minimal presentation they're known for, with a menu that sets them apart from their other brands \u2014 signatures have been brought from the old location but with further tweaks and balancing, and new classic twists are in.\r\n\r\nThe new signature menu is themed around grocery shopping, with sections on produce, dairy, and more. As Messengerservice, they're delivering those groceries into your hands. Those groceries just happen to come with booze. Highlights include the \"Corn + Basil + Paprika,\" a tequila-based cocktail with flavours true to the name and joined together by olive brine and coconut, their \"MS Clover Club\" which takes a spin on the classic Clover Club with lacto-fermented raspberries and clarified yoghurt, as well as their twist on the Negroni with palo santo.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0Messengerservice\r\nOpening times: Tue-Sun, 6pm-midnight (until 1am on Fri-Sat)\r\nLocation: 3rd Floor, Baan Trok Tua Ngork, Thanon Santiphap, Pom Prap, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Wat Mongkon, MRT\r\n\r\n\r\nBar Marco's new signature cocktail menu is fun, colourful, and very Mondrian\r\nInspired by Piet Mondrian's timeless abstract artworks, Bar Marco debuted a signature menu that are very colourful, and serves as perfect pick-me-ups with some company. Complex, but not complicated; intimate, but not without their warm hospitality. Plus, the additions to the food menu and DJs behind the station at the regular keep the vibes going from opening till late. Also, do yourself a favour and order their kaprao.\r\n\r\nAs fun touches, each drink is named after popular songs. \"Black in Black\", one of the anthems of straight men is turned into a whisky-based drink with black sesame, butter, coconut, vinegar, and black cherry. \"Call Me Maybe\" made us trade our souls for wish, penny and dimes for a kiss \u2014 an easy-going cocktail with gin, pink peppercorn, cinnamon, and apple. \"Too Sweet\" is a drink that had us surprised, not only because how well coffee, coconut milk, and carbonation work well together, but also because Hozier really made a song about not being a morning person.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0Bar Marco\r\nOpening times: Open daily, 6pm-2am\r\nLocation: 946\/9 Sukhumvit Road, Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Thonglor, BTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Backroom's full signature menu repackages classic cocktails while staying true to their essence\r\nAfter a busy day, we just wanted a spot where the gin is cold and the piano is hot, and The Backroom has both to offer. The drinking spot in Yenakart's full signature menu features a few fun cocktails of their own \u2014 one with wasabi sprouts and another pairing rum with roasted coconut \u2014 but where they shine the brightest is their classic twists. In fact, it feels less like a twist, and more like an homage.\r\n\r\nThe \"Bee's Kiss\" takes a spin on the post-prohibition cocktail Bee's Knees using Arabica honey, then topped with honey meringue and bee pollen. The \"Ghost of Mary\" pulled the Bloody Mary out of its spot at brunch and turned it appropriate for any time, made using vodka, tomato water, clarified lemon, green chili, holy basil, complete with a half salt rim. The \"Wake Up in Thailand\" plays on the Espresso Martini with cold brew from Doi Saket, chocolate, and Frangelico (hazelnut and herbal-flavoured liqueur), resulting in a less-sweet, well-balanced drink that packs a punch of coffee flavour.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0The Backroom\r\nOpening times: Tue-Sun, 7pm-2am\r\nLocation: 35\/5 - 35\/7, second floor, Soi Si Bamphen, Thung Maha Mek, Sathon, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon\r\nNearest station: Khlong Toei, MRT\r\n\r\n\r\nBubbs features a cocktail experience without sugar nor syrup\r\nEveryday feels like a Friday night at Bubbs.

Head bartender Vivek Yadav makes sure that all the drinks stay true to the concept without sacrificing the ingredients nor balance.\r\n\r\nHighlights you must try include the \"Tonka\", made with vodka infused with vanilla and tonka beans, Malibu, Midori, passionfruit, and topped with cream and grated tonka, the \"Amrut\", a tequila-based drink with guava, jalapeno, and black salt, as we as the \"Narangi\", a light start to the evening made with gin, clarified orange juice, vanilla liqueur, and orange blossom.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0Bubbs\r\nOpening times: Tue-Sun, 5.30pm-midnight\r\nLocation: 22, 2 Sukhumvit 47 Alley, Khwaeng Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Phrom Phong, BTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTICTACTOE is a bar that encourages you to find that special someone\r\n\"Love sold here\", said TICTACTOE. As part of Emwonder, the pink and purple-tinted lounge with warm lights encourages you to find love at their bar. Whether you want to start off with something intimate \u2014 perhaps some live music to groove to \u2014 or a fun-filled session with live DJs, they have you covered. The seats are designed to be seamless, connecting to each other, as a nudge-nudge, wink-wink, to the ones who perhaps found love sitting an inch beside them.\r\n\r\nTheir 11 signature cocktails tell the story of a flirty date night, one that could happen to you. Start the night off with the \"Hello, Stranger\", an easy-going drink that feels inviting to the touch. \"Just the Two of Us\" really says that we could make it if we try, because the THB 890 price tag comes in two glasses for the two people with sparks in their eyes. \"Netflix and Chill\" is also another drink to which describing the details of the activity referenced could make a Victorian-era woman faint from embarrassment. Feeling fun? They also got vodka shots with caviar to pair.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0TICTACTOE\r\nOpening times: Open daily, 7pm onwards\r\nLocation: 5th Floor, Emsphere, 628 Sukhumvit Rd, Khlong Tan, Khlong Toei,Bangkok, Thailand\r\nNearest station: Phrom Phong, BTS\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1932162\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1080\"] Image credit: WYWS Cocktail Bar\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\nWYWS Cocktail Bar takes guests on a train ride around the world through drinks\r\nAbbreviated from \"Where You Wander?

This station acts like a connecting sector to train station around the world, to which those who wander in can discover through their menu.\r\n\r\nThe \"Time Square 42nd\" is a basically a sour with bourbon, corn milk, and brown butter syrup. \"Kawaguchiko\" features green tea gin, fortified wine, lemon juice, ume plum syrup, and egg white; a refreshing take on Japan.

Ruby was hurt by a who she thought was the one; they went on a beautiful journey together, yet he left before the day breaks. Stung by a shattered heart, she reminded herself of the woman most fearless of all, one not to be shaken by any other man again: herself. As any sensible women would do, Ruby brushed herself off, and used the pain to start a cocktail programme.\r\n\r\nWith Langsuan as the backdrop, Ruby concocts 14 cocktails and 2 mocktails inspired by gemstones. The bar boasts a 16-seat experience \u2014 a place not only for drinks, but also for intimate talks and perhaps sultry conversations.\r\n\r\nAlthough the large, beautiful menu is a joy to flip through in itself, some of the signatures got a hold on us and won't let go. These include the \"Emerald,\" a fun, vibrant cocktail made with gin, artisanal mezcal, melon, mango sticky rice and durian coconut foam, the \"Diamond,\" a tequila-based drink with notes of yoghurt, citrus, and pear, as well as the \"Sunstone,\" a spirit-forward crafted using whisky, mezcal, saffron, porcini mushrooms, and jasmine rice.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0Ruby's\r\nOpening times: Open daily, 5.30pm-midnight\r\nLocation: L floor, Kimpton Maa-Lai Bangkok, 78 Soi Ton Son, Lumphini, Pathum Wan, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Chit Lom, BTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Loft takes us on a tour through contemporary history through their new cocktail menu\r\nThe 20th century is full of wonders: its innovations, ideas, influences, and more, directly affect our daily lives more than we think. The year 1928 saw Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, paving the way to modern medicine. In 1969, humankind witnessed Neil Armstrong's historic step on the moon. In 1977, Saturday Night Fever launched the population into disco inferno. It is just magical looking back at what we could accomplish in a mere hundred years.\r\n\r\nBar Manager and history teacher Song Terbsiri condensed all the good times throughout the century into The Loft's new signature cocktails. The \"Pizzeria,\" telling the story of how Pizza Margherita arrives in New York, spawning countless twists of the dish, including this cocktail, is made with vodka, tomato liqueur, toasted bell pepper basil, and topped with a beautiful cream cheese foam. The \"Rock & Roll\" represents the sounds of 1950s youth culture that resonates today \u2014 a cognac-based drink with banana liqueur and peanut butter syrup. The \"Level Up\" is a gin-based sour with notes of yuzu and watermelon, harkening back to the arcade boom of the 1970s.\r\n\r\nAll of those, and more, are available as you climb into the time machine that is The Loft.\r\n\r\nMore info:\u00a0The Loft Bangkok\r\nOpening times: Open daily, 5pm-midnight (till 1am on Fri-Sat)\r\nLocation: Level 56, Waldorf Astoria Bangkok, 151 Ratchadamri Rd, Lumphini, Pathum Wan, Bangkok\r\nNearest station: Ratchadamri, BTS\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThurty opens as a cosy living room amidst the bustling Chinatown area\r\nThe age of thirty is, to many, a turning point in their lives. It's the age where the family notices you're getting too old to receive money in family gatherings; yet too young to have kids come ask you for advice. You're too old to run towards love \"like all the kids,\" yet too young to consider marriage like your friends had.\r\n\r\nThurty turns those unique stories of dreams and passions that come with age into cocktails, with a living room-esque interior designed for guests to interact. The menu also encourages guests to relate themselves to the story of each drink before the ingredients within. After all, what's a good story if you can't share it with the people you care about most?\r\n\r\nAbandon the world and be a \"Backpacker,\" a savoury-fizzy aperitif with rum, canned fish cordial, and topped with tonic. Remember (or dream about) your \"1st Million\" with a beautiful Remy Martin VSOP-based drink with homemade strawberry cordial and dry sparkling wine, served with duck as a pairing.

But what if we dial it up to a hundred, so high it loops back to being interesting again? Buph Phe Bar has opened pn Yaowarat road, and their signature cocktail menu doesn't feature anything that isn't found in Thailand. Every spirit is Thai-made, each fruit from local sources or other provinces, and all pairings are Thai snacks made in-house. The country is huge, with each area containing its own characteristics to discover, and this bar's unapologetic approach to Thai-inspired cocktails is as refreshing as it can be.\r\n\r\n\"Sun\" is Isaan in a glass, and it's made from liquor distilled from coconut flower; a bountiful commodity from Sakon Nakhon, sweetened with tamarind sauce and paired with crispy jelly. If you'd prefer a trip to the east, \"Island\" showcases quite an uncommon fruit. The guttiferae (local name mapam) is a tropical fruit grown in Chantaburi in the same family as the mangosteen. It's then combined with two different species of cardamom, coconut milk, and pineapple juice, served alongside Thai coconut meringue.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information at Buph Phe Bar.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1917514\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Image credit: Vichayuth Chantan\/Lifestyle Asia[\/caption]\r\nInvitation Only is like if Wes Anderson opened his own bar, complete with fun signature cocktails\r\nOpen daily, 5pm onwards\r\n\r\nWith the sheer number of new bars in Bangkok, we think it has taken too long for a hotel-themed one to appear.

An abbreviation for \"Genius On Drugs,\" the bar aims to be inventive, experimental, and raw. The establishment plays into that feeling as well, with the interior reminiscent of a desecrated church brought back to life still with the exposed brick walls and jarring beams. Our advice is to sit at the bar and wait patiently to be showered with G.O.D's love.\r\n\r\nThe first cocktail menu is titled \"Excessive is Necessary\" with bar bites to pair with each drink. Their \"Oyster Martini\" is made with oyster juice, and served with actual Fine de Claire No.2 oyster and Coppa ham.

The cocktail menu at first glance draws inspiration from the Old World, with a drink paying homage to The Great Gatsby, and another named after a Wong Kar-Wai film.

It\u2019s crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and there are delicious chunks of perfectly-cooked crab meat found throughout the dish \u2014 one mouthful feels like a foodgasm.\r\n\r\n Image credit: @jayfaibankok\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\r\nThai Stir-fried Rice Noodle (THB 600)\r\nThai Stir-fried Rice Noodle, locally known as\u00a0Phad See Ew.\u00a0Rice noodles are stir-fried with soy sauce and other condiments until they are the golden brown colour they're known for. The sweet and salty flavours go very well with seafood.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1819421\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1080\"] Image credit: @jayfaibankok\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeafood Drunken Noodle (THB 1,000)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet drunk off joy eating Jay Fai's Phad Khee Mao.\u00a0If you're looking for a spicy variation of Phad See Ww, this is it. With holy basil and chili, it makes for a very enjoyable dish you can't stop having, even if it's burning your tongue off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1819420\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1350\"] Image credit: @jayfaibankok\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStir-Fried Prawns in Yellow Curry (THB 1,800)\r\nAuthentic stir-fried curry is always a treat. You need a good balance between wet and dry ingredients, otherwise it feels awkward in your mouth. We feel Jay Fai has it done right, and the fresh prawns taste great with the curry gravy.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1925063\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1080\"] Image credit: jayfaibangkok\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrab Meat Holy Basil Stir-Fry (special order, THB 1,400)\r\nCannot really dine at a Thai restaurant and not order krapow, can you? Fresh chunks of crab meat with that hot and spicy chili and basil just hits different. It's perfect for those who come solo, or prefer to order to share. Order a fried egg because you can't have krapow without a fried egg.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1819443\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1080\"] Image credit: @jayfaibankok\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStir-fried Crabmeat with Black Pepper Sauce (THB 1,000)\r\nSugar, spice, and everything nice? This is the dish to order. Crab meat has its own sweetness, and it is complimented very well by the kick from black pepper. It's not really a spicy dish, either, so everyone in the family can order and enjoy this must-try at Jay Fai.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1925062\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1080\"] Image credit: jayfaibangkok\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\nDry Congee (THB 600)\r\nIf you're looking for a carb other than plain white rice, Jay Fai's dry congee is a treat. It's dryer than your usual Thai-style congee, but you'll still fully taste the flavourful broth in each bite. It's perfect for a sharing-style meal so you'll get to taste the congee with many other dishes. We even recommended Lisa Blackpink to try it when she visited Jay Fai.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1925064\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1080\"] Image credit: jayfaibangkok\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\nSeafood Dry Tom Yum (THB 1,000)\r\nMany are acquainted with Thai cuisine through tom yum. The kick of spice, the sweet and sour notes, the complexity \u2014 we can't get enough of it. Imagine that without the broth, yet with the char from stir-frying the seafood. That's the signature dry tom yum Jay Fai has.\r\n\r\n\r\nJay Fai, 327 Maha Chai Road, Samran Rat, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok. Open Wednesday-Sunday from 9.00am-9.00pm.

It's also a staple addition to hotpots, and can be found at just about every children's birthday party. In Hong Kong, fish balls are also some of the best loved snacks, and can be found in some of the most popular cha chaan tengs, snack kiosks, and street food stalls across the island. Everyone has their beloved go-to for the humble Hong Kong-style fish ball, but in case you don't, here are some of the best in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nHong Kong shares many similar dishes with Singapore, such as chee cheong fun and the egg tart, but there are obvious differences despite being made with similar ingredients and methods. The same goes for the fish balls in Hong Kong, where differences in elasticity, colour, and flavour can be noted. For one, they're known to be firmer, darker, and have a more pronounced fishy taste and aroma in Hong\u00a0Kong than Singapore.\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1933634\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"806\"] Image credit: @pakloh.hk\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\n\r\nRegardless, they're delicious and these establishments have perfected the art of these bouncy treats. Many of these fish balls are hand-made creations of long-time recipes that have been passed down from generations, and are served in a myriad of styles, from boiled, and flash-fried to slathered in a coat of home-made chilli oil, peanut-y satay mix or curry sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the humble street snack that many will have grown up with, everyone has a loyal favourite.

Read on to see the places you should put on your bucket list.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking of classic Hong Kong snacks, the egg tart often sits at the top of the list. It\u2019s a great local pastry that one can\u2019t simply pass off. There\u2019s no shortage of guidebooks or word-of-mouth recommendations highlighting the deliciousness of this miniature pastry. For this month\u2019s edition of chef recommendations, we ask chef Gr\u00e9goire Michaud of Bakehouse for his top picks. He shares his favourite spots for the best egg tarts in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let its palm-sized appearance fool you. A Hong Kong egg tart packs a punch. This beloved pastry traces its history to the 1940s. It is a revamped take on the English custard tart and the Portuguese pastel de nata. Today, it comes in many forms and can easily be found all over the city. Many cha chann teng continue to serve it but bakeries also offer their own unique take that still stay true to what makes the dish so loved in the first place.\r\n\r\nOne of those bakeries is Bakehouse. Since opening its doors in 2018, the European-style bakery has gained a cult following, its reputation reaching even beyond Hong Kong\u2019s shores. At the helm of Bakehouse is veteran pastry chef Gr\u00e9goire Michaud who cut his culinary teeth as early as 15 years old with an apprenticeship at a local bakery in his home country, Switzerland. His journey in Hong Kong started 30 years ago. It includes an eight-year tenure at Four Seasons before deciding to step up his expertise in artisanal production.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFrom there, Bakehouse Wholesale (previously known as Bread Elements) was born in 2013. Thanks to its success, chef Michaud decided to open his first neighbourhood shop, Bakehouse in 2018. Quickly, it amassed patrons both in Hong Kong and overseas, mostly for its sourdough egg tarts, among other treats. Six years in, it\u2019s still normal to find a long queue outside Bakehouse locations.

There I was, rhythmically turning my head from chef to dish and back again, as the food before me was explained in great detail, including the source of its ingredients, the strenuous exercise to whip it into shape, and the meticulous use of tweezers involved in its presentation. My fork hardly began its journey onto the plate, when what felt like a stadium floodlight stabbed me in the cornea. Bringing an LED light to a restaurant: Instagram fam, are we taking food photography too far?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForget \u201cbon appetit.\u201d These days, \u201ccamera eats first\u201d feels like the more common phrase uttered at dinner. No longer encouraged to \u201cdig in,\u201d many of us have become accustomed to a ritual of pre-meal photo-snapping. While in some cases this involves a mere tap on the iPhone camera app, for others, it is a proper production \u2014 LED light, tripod, et al.\r\n[Hero Image Credit: Mikegles\/Pexels]\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1933861\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"504\"] Image Credit: David Diniz\/Pexels[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no denying that good lighting is key to a good photo, and that appropriate lighting can make or break your restaurant experience. Nonetheless, the two used to be mutually exclusive. I digitally nodded to every word in this viral story on Eater last month \u2014 titled \u201cPlease Put Your Light Away at the Restaurant,\u201d it doesn\u2019t get more straight-forward than that \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t until this brutal invasion of my privacy (and my eyesight) that I fully understood its meaning. As someone who also owns a video light and uses it for restaurant reviews at work, I took a long hard look in my well-lit mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat one local chef rightly describes as a \u201cdouble-edged sword,\u201d using a handheld light at the dining table is a more complex affair than it may seem. Who can deny that a well-lit photograph can wholly change the perception of a dish, or even a restaurant? It\u2019s hard to find the balance, somewhere between new rules for dining etiquette, the power of social media influence, and the value of private experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome armed with food photography lights, others wearing a proverbial cross to avoid them, we checked in with local F&B experts to find the answer. Is it (ever) okay to bring an LED light to dinner? Let us enlighten you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion: Is it appropriate to bring a food photography light to a restaurant\/bar?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1933772\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Charles Deluvio\/Unsplash[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe case for letting the camera eat first: The free marketing is kind of lit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may have already blocked out this period of time, but for a brief moment, transport yourself back to the Covid-19 era. Many sectors were suffering, and the restaurant and bar industries were among the worst to be hit. As a publication, it was high time for us to promote small businesses as much as we could. We shared their promotions, we spread the word, and if we could, we took photos of their product to enhance this. Naturally, an LED light came in super handy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst no one is discriminating against proper food photographers, there is plenty to say for the rise of amateur food photographers. A few searches on Shopee or Lazada yield an impressive number of tools for your disposal. You can buy gimlets, tripods, ring lights, and even coloured lights online. With the right angles and a little bit of practice, anyone can become a food and drink photographer \u2014 and become a food and drink photographer many did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s no wonder that TikTok exploded at a time when people had the most time to spend online. Viral dances and dumb challenges took over the internet during the pandemic, but they also gave birth to a fresh avalanche of lifestyle bloggers, vloggers, and influencers. As we emerged back into restaurants, coffeeshops, and bars post-pandemonium, they suddenly entered armed with new skills and hot tools. If the right one came to your venue, you could see a queue that went around the block, and suddenly, business could be booming again.\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1933855\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Sasha Kim\/Pexels[\/caption]\r\nOf course, this changed the business model. Jon Spearman, chef-owner of Pizzeria Mazzie, one of the world\u2019s top 50 pizzerias, knows this, and took lighting into consideration when renovating his restaurant. \u201cWe have financed a large budget on lighting inside our restaurant during the recent expansion, to be comfortable for guests, but also with social media photos being such an important part of dining out, in mind.\u201d\r\nEncouraging food photography, then, is a clever way to support free marketing, and though it may have started as a trend at first, it looks like it's here to stay.\r\nFood writer, Travel + Leisure tastemaker, and chef, Mario Tolentino echoes the sentiment: \u201cThoughtful design in the modern dining age is essential. People love to share the amazing meals we provide them and we should think about that as operators when designing our restaurants. I definitely do not see this going away, it\u2019s not a trend, this a societal behaviour, we need to adapt and create an environment that is suitable for our guests\u2026there is a challenge in striking the balance on guest behaviour and creating the atmosphere and environment for our concepts.\u201d\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1933778\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Greg Rosenke\/Unsplash[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe case for leaving your light at home: Is nothing sacred anymore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe central argument in Jaya Saxena\u2019s Eater article is about ambience, and that not everybody in a restaurant environment wants to be a part of your content. Perhaps bringing a light makes for a nice photo on your \u2018gram, and the venue owner is super happy about it, and you feel super cool about creating fun content around it, but what about table seven?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is where it struck a chord for me last weekend. Though I am now used to seeing new and older food journalists bringing a light to work, I still felt massively disturbed by its presence. Held incorrectly and left on for far too long, it shone an aggressive beam in all the wrong directions, changed the otherwise tranquil vibe of the evening, and, contrary to its function, did not lighten the mood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of an LED light in a public space emphasises notions of the self versus the community in a public setting. Dining out is a communal activity, even if you\u2019re not seated at communal tables. There are manners to adhere to, and unspoken rules to observe. We respect each other in this space. Nonetheless, we are entering uncharted territory. While our forefathers set a few rules for how to break bread with strangers, they never had to worry about 300 lumens shining havoc on an amuse bouche.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if we zoom in on the individual in a public setting, Saxena is right: \u201ceveryone is there to experience the whole, not be made to watch as you selfishly man a literal spotlight.\u201d However dinner or drinks is going, it should be your experience, and your experience alone. \u201cYou do not consent to suddenly becoming a studio audience.\u201d\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1933852\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"537\"] Image Credit: UrFriendlyPhotog\/Pexels[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe case for middle ground: Consent, the Gen-Z way\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomehow, there is a middle ground to be found here, and it lies at the peripherals of phone and dining etiquette, but also the design of the new F&B experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamantha Proyrungtong, a double-agent with a foot in restaurant PR and another in owning her own French restaurant, says, \u201cDiscreet with a small light is okay, but studio lights, tripods, and flashes that can bring down planes is inappropriate\u2026For those who warn in advance, there\u2019s always areas to place them to avoid disturbances.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome venues even provide lights to customers, so as to encourage clear vision, but also to manage the amount of exposure. Arguably one of the best new bar openings this year, G.O.D. is one of these places, where the desecrated church ambience would be destroyed by uncontrolled, cold vlogging light. The bartenders here will shine a quick light onto your cocktail following its presentation, allowing you a few seconds to take a snap and get it over with. For bigger productions, you\u2019d have to contact owner Niks Anuman. Fittingly, G.O.D. stands for \u201cgenius on drugs.\u201d\r\nSpeaking more broadly on the use of lights at his bars (he helms Bangkok\u2019s notorious YOLO Group), Niks puts it bluntly: \u201cBring a light, bring a dog, bring your own music, bring a candle, bring a dumbbell, bring food, bring anything \u2014 but please ask for approval or permission before using any of those. If the bartender is okay with it, then go for it.\u201d\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1933849\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Varan\/Pexels[\/caption]\r\nBangkok-based food journalist Pruepat Songtieng understands. Knowing that the way forward is paved with good lighting, she finds the balance: \u201cIt\u2019s understandable if you have to work, but please\u00a0always ask restaurants for a recommended table that won\u2019t disturb others.\u201d\r\nCustomers and vendors need to work together on this, as behaviours in drink and dining spaces evolve, and call for understanding on both ends. Unlike bringing your pet to a pet-friendly restaurant, or your baby to a friends and family dinner, there is a need for consent for individual food photography lighting.\r\nAfter we meet at a dinner party where all was calm and all was bright, Masterchef Thailand Season 5 contestant and beloved food blogger Tasinee Kiattikhunphan (ChubbynHungry) has normalised it. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty commonplace nowadays,\u201d affirming that she does not mind being around a light in a restaurant, and even uses a light in a restaurant. \u201cBut sometimes, I love to enjoy my dinner the old school way.\u201d\r\nSeemingly, the question now presents itself whether you\u2019re \u201cold school\u201d or \u201cnew school\u201d on this subject, and as I try to find a conclusion fitting with the times, it is best to sum it up using local language from within this space. In 2024, we\u2019ve come to learn, if you decide to bring a private LED light to a restaurant, be sure to be so very mindful, very demure when you do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Chick-fil-A will open its first store in Asia in Singapore in 2025","position":33,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/dining\/chick-fil-a-singapore-first-store-2025-asia-debut-details\/","description":"Chick-fil-A is finally coming to Asia with its very first store opening in Singapore in 2025.\r\n\r\nAlready a household name in the United States for its signature chicken creations like the iconic Chicken Sandwich, Chick-fil-A will officially debut in Asia with its first Singapore store sometime in late 2025.\r\nWhat to know about Chick-fil-A's first Asia store in Singapore so far\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1933931\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1024\"] Chicken and Smiles pop-up by Chick-fil-A at The Esplanade Mall.

While the premise is simple (rice, protein, egg, and vegetables), there are so many different styles and cuisines to choose from. Do you head to the famous places like Jay Fai and Here Hai for the crab fried rice? Chains like Savoey and Somboon for Chinese or pineapple fried rice? How about \u2018American\u2019 fried rice, famously, Jackson Wang\u2019s beloved dish at Foodland?\r\nSome would argue that it doesn\u2019t truly matter where you get your fried rice, because all fried rice is still somehow good fried rice. After all, this dish is famously best prepared with day-old rice, and often serves as a beloved late-night or hungover morning khao pad craving.\r\nNonetheless, the search for the best fried rice can be an overwhelming one, as sometimes it feels like the most perfect dish of khao pad bu or khao pad sapparot is hiding in plain sight.

For decades, it has served as one of the city's most notable main veins, with addresses bearing its name constituting hot commodities among real estate investors for its proximity to the cosmopolitan high life.\r\n\r\nYet, most Klang Valley denizens tend not to raise too many eyebrows when the name 'Damai' is brought up in conversation. That's likely owing to the fact that the moniker is shared by several neighbourhoods across Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. In the case of its Ampang counterpart, Damai is best associated with the LRT station that bears its name along the Kelana Jaya Line, located by the bank of the Klang River.\r\n\r\nFrom afar, a cluster of low-slung bungalows from the 1970s and 1980s indicates the neighbourhood's prestige, with several embassies still maintaining offices within their ageing walls. Three schools and a small arts college campus line its main street.

Here are some of our food recommendations to find in Wisma Cosway on your next trip to Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur has inevitably evolved into an unrecognisable metropolitan sprawl from its formative days as a tin-ore town. Long gone are the markers of a humble, if not provincial settlement, replaced by towering skyscrapers that are evidence of Malaysia's continued economic prosperity and prominence. And one of the earliest markers of the city's cosmopolitan ambitions can be found in Wisma Cosway.\r\n\r\nEasily hidden from view along Jalan Raja Chulan by its glitzy neighbours, with Pavilion Kuala Lumpur across the street easily overshadowing all other properties within the vicinity, it's easy to dismiss Wisma Cosway's significance to local built heritage. But the fact is, this is likely one of the last few remaining office complexes of its age left in the city, having remained in operation since opening its doors in 1978. For the record, that's 46 years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the face of sleek glass, steel and postmodern concrete, Wisma Cosway's relatively mundane, flat-sided architecture may not inspire many glances. But step in, and you will find yourself being transported back to a Kuala Lumpur that almost no longer exists. Tiled ceilings and columns are lit by fluorescence, while mom-and-pop businesses, such as dentists, tailors, and even a travel agent's office, continue to remain in service to those who know.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is the restaurants and eateries here that are especially noteworthy, offering affordable bites for office workers across the city who rightfully refuse to stomach the prices of RM30 lunches.
