Pops","position":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/celebrities-who-collect-toys-memorabilia-collectibles-labubu-star-wars-funko\/","description":"\r\nFrom Lisa to James Gunn, these are the celebrities who love to collect various toys.\r\nThe world of collectibles spans far and wide, transcending genres and industries with global appeal to people from all walks of life. While sports fans may collect jerseys, hats, and various other paraphernalia popularised by their sporting idols, pop culture fans have long made lucrative hobbies out of collecting action figurines and toys. Thanks to BLACKPINK\u2019s Lalisa, Labubu doll supremacy has reached a fever pitch this past month. But it\u2019s not the first, nor will it be the last toy that has garnered celebrity attention. In light of that, we look at all the celebrities who collect toys, as well as what they favour.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor as long as humans have walked the earth, we have gathered trinkets and trophies. Like magpies drawn to shiny things, many humans enjoy the process of collecting, cataloguing, and displaying conspicuous symbols of their hobbies and interests. From trading cards and rogue baseballs to vinyl records and rare liquors, the possibilities are endless when it comes to building a collection.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeet the hottest new collector\u2019s item in town: The Labubu doll from Kasing Lung\u2019s The Monsters collection of collectibles, produced and distributed by Pop Mart.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA post shared by @labubu (@labubuofficial)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe toothy little monster recently enjoyed a supersonic burst of popularity\u00a0when\u00a0K-Pop girl group BLACKPINK\u2019s Lalisa Manobal was revealed to have a collection. Lisa\u2019s passive endorsement proved to be incredibly lucrative for Pop Mart, with toys and other accessories from The Monsters collection flying off the shelves at the speed of light. Want to buy one to get in on the hype? You\u2019d best be prepared for war, with BLACKPINK fans (also known as Blinks) storming to Pop Mart retailers en masse, eager to grab a Labubu of their own.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo why are collectibles and rare finds such a big deal?\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lucrative side of toy collecting\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot all collectors engage in the art of curation simply for profit. Lalisa\u2019s fans, for example, are likely embroiled in Labubu fever for the pure and simple purpose of owning a toy beloved by their idol. However, it cannot be denied that the collectible industry has become a lucrative endeavour enjoyed by those with the means to sink up to millions in purchasing the rarest of finds; most notably, the industry is worth a whopping USD 601.2 billion\u00a0as of 2024.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTopping the list of the most expensive collectibles ever sold is a 1933 Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle coin, which survived the gold confiscation of the Great Depression.

Understandably, exclusivity and rarity are both essential to the resale market and can significantly boost the selling price of a collectible by millions.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith millions on the line, the race is on for collectors seeking to turn passion into profit. Yet, where these stars are concerned, the true joy of collecting lies beyond the dollars and cents. Read on to learn more about these 10 celebrities who collect toys and other collectibles.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCelebrities who collect toys and other collectibles\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLalisa Manobal \u2013 Labubu\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-Bci1a1CF80&pp=ygUMbGlzYSB2YXJpZXR5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKPINK\u2019s Lisa revealed that she owns a collection of Labubu dolls from Kasing Lung\u2019s The Monsters collection. In a now-expired Instagram story, the world-renowned singer was shown gleefully unboxing her collection of Labubu toys. Further fuelling the Labubu hype train, Lisa also posted a picture sporting a blue plush Labubu pendant keychain from the Macaron series, pairing it with a Constance bag from Herm\u00e8s. To thank Lisa for her passive endorsement of his work, The Monsters creator Kasing Lung revealed in an interview that he sent her a mega Labubu. If you were still doubting just how much of a fan Lisa was of the now-famous monster, she proves her love in a recent Vanity Fair interview. In the video, the artist expertly differentiates Labubu and Zimomo, recounts how her obsession started, and also opens up a number of mystery items.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma Roberts \u2013 Dollikins dolls\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis past April, actress Emma Roberts gave a tour of her Los Angeles home to Architectural Digest, revealing her collection of dolls. In the video, an excited Roberts showed off her \u2018Doll Wall\u2019, pointing out several Dollikins dolls including her first (and favourite) of the lot. Roberts then showed off \u2018Leggy Jill\u2019, adding that she had been looking for the doll for over a year before her boyfriend finally surprised her with it on her birthday. \u201cI took her out of the box, which he did not approve of,\u201d Roberts said, adding, \u201cI take my dolls out of the box, which people get very up in arms about.

According to sources, DiCaprio\u2019s priceless collection of around 80 figurines from the 1970s and 1980s are kept \u2018under lock and key for protection\u2019. According to reports, DiCaprio is known to use a pseudonym when bidding on rare items online, further fuelling his passion for growing his collection. Despite harbouring a keen interest in the Star Wars franchise and even meeting director George Lucas, DiCaprio interestingly turned down the role of Anakin Skywalker in the '90s, expressing that he did not feel ready to take the dive.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe actor is also known to have auctioned off pieces of his collection in support of charitable causes, funded through the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. Beyond Star Wars figurines, DiCaprio also collects other vintage toys from other popular franchises like He-Man and Planet of the Apes.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuentin Tarantino \u2013 Board games\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown for Pulp Fiction (1994), Inglorious Basterds (2009), and the Kill Bill franchise, director Quentin Tarantino lives up to his reputation as one who lives and breathes the film industry. A true devotee of the silver screen, Tarantino\u2019s collection is composed of pop culture memorabilia, including vintage board games based on TV shows and movies. Among his collection are games inspired by popular cult-classic shows like The Dukes of Hazzard, The A-Team, Dawn of the Dead, Saturday Night Fever, Grease, and Welcome Back, Kotter. According to reports, Tarantino also collects television-related memorabilia including lunch boxes and action figures alike.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohnny Depp \u2013 Barbies\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile many celebrities have access to limited edition collectibles, few can boast of having a collection of Barbie dolls as expansive as actor Johnny Depp\u2019s. According to reports, Depp\u2019s foray into the wonderful world of Barbie first began when he used to play Barbie dolls with his daughter. During playtime, Depp practised a range of voices, with the endeavour serving him well in developing his movie roles. When his daughter eventually stopped playing with the dolls, the actor kept them, with reports suggesting he has gone on to expand his collection. Sources have claimed that Depp owns dozens of limited-edition Barbie dolls. Additionally, the actor also collects celebrity dolls, including Donny and Marie Osmond, Beyonce and Destiny\u2019s Child, Elvis Presley, New Kids on the Block, and the High School Musical cast. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRosie O\u2019Donnell \u2013 McDonalds toys\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA post shared by Rosie O\u2019Donnell (@rosie)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to reports, comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell has a collection comprising over 2,500 Happy Meal toys from McDonalds. O\u2019Donnell has proudly displayed her collection on her talk show desk. In an interview with People magazine, it was revealed that she began collecting the toys in the 1980s, simply because they reminded her of her childhood.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJanet Jackson \u2013 Pig memorabilia\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA post shared by Janet Jackson (@janetjackson)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite alleging that she had been called \u2018pig\u2019 and \u2018cow\u2019 by her brother Michael while growing up, Janet Jackson appears to have taken control of the narrative to great effect. The singer, who shared that her brother\u2019s jibes had caused no small amount of anguish, ended up collecting porcelain pigs in her adult years.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking to Contact Music in 2006, Jackson shed light on how she started her collection, sharing that she had no idea why. \u201cI always wanted a hobby, so I decided to collect pigs. I have no idea why! And everyone started giving them to me.\u201d However, the singer eventually came to the realisation that her pig memorabilia was taking up too much space, leading her to abandon the project. \u201cI had hundreds of pigs. I mean, really, what was I supposed to do with them? So I gave it up!\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Gunn \u2013 Funko Pops\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Image: James Gunn\/Facebook)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFunko Pops are an integral element in the business of superhero-related collectibles. To the delight of fans and fandoms, characters from TV shows and movies spanning numerous genres and franchises\u00a0have become immortalised in the form of these iconic, adorably large-headed figurines. Among the most popular Funko Pops? Marvel superheroes.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirector James Gunn of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise is a known collector of Funko Pops, especially those relating to the franchise. Most notably, Gunn is one in 15 movie directors who have been honoured with Funko Pop figurines of their own. In 2017, Funko released a limited-edition James Gunn Pop which was sold at the New York Comic Con in October that same year, with only 500 available.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRobin Williams \u2013 Toy soldiers, robots, and figurines\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Image: Sothesby's)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile he lived, the world\u2019s favourite funny man Robin Williams owned a massive collection of toys, figurines, and various other collectibles from a multitude of movie franchises. Notably, the beloved comedian's collection included numerous toy soldiers, robots, and various figurines from the Star Wars and Dungeons and Dragons franchises.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Williams\u2019 tragic death in 2014, his daughter Zelda reached out to the internet for help in identifying the most obscure finds in his expansive collection. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMike Tyson \u2013 X-Men collectibles\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidently a huge fan of the X-Men franchise, boxer and actor Mike Tyson is also a renowned collector. His most prized collection? An assortment of ToyBiz X-Men action figures. In a 1996 interview with Roseanne Barr, Tyson shows off his incredible collection, even going so far as to break down the lore from X-Factor, a satellite X-Men team that few but hardcore fans would know.\r\n \r\nSpecial mention: Dua Lipa\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936564\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"460\"] Image credit: @dualipa Instagram[\/caption]\r\nIt's unclear whether the Albanian-English singer is a collector but she recently posted a story on her Instagram with two Labubus hanging on what seemed to be her purse while she was in Kuala Lumpur for her \"Radical Optimism Tour\". Whether these were given to her or Dua bought them for herself still remains to be seen. But if Dua is willing to show off two of the monsters then she deserves at least an honorable mention on this list.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Main image: James Gunn\/@jamesgunn\/Instagram, Lisa Manobal\/@lalalalisa_m\/Instagram; featured image: James Gunn\/@jamesgunn\/Instagram)\r\n\r\n "},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Ava vs Moo Deng: Who would win in a fight?","position":2,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/ava-vs-moo-deng-who-would-win-in-a-fight\/","description":"New day, new viral zoo animal.

(Image credit: Yoo Yeon-seok\/Instagram)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Netflix K-drama starts with Sa-eon attending a party alongside Hee-joo. As they enter, he asks her to be careful and not let people doubt their relationship.\r\n\r\nThe scene cuts to Hee-joo working as a sign language interpreter at a news agency. Viewers soon discover that while Hee-joo is Sa-eon's wife, the Baek family has kept her identity hidden. This is because she is just filling in the shoes of her missing sister Hong In-a, who was initially supposed to marry Sa-eon.\r\n\r\nLater, while driving back to her home, Hee-joo's car starts malfunctioning and soon an anonymous man takes Hee-joo hostage. He then calls Sa-eon and threatens to kill his wife if he does not pay him ransom. Sa-eon cuts the call and cross-checks about Hee-joo's whereabouts with her mother, who lies that Hee-joo is having dinner with her. A relieved Sa-eon once again receives a call from the kidnapper. Enraged, he dares the kidnapper to call him when he has an actual corpse to show him. This angers Hee-joo and she somehow speeds her car up, crosses a speed breaker, and injures the kidnapper in that process.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of episode 1, the narrative shifts to the first scene of the party. Sa-eon receives a call from the kidnapper once again as Hee-joo leaves for the washroom. This time the caller reveals his location, which takes Sa-eon by surprise. The caller then narrates the truth about his marriage and demands that he must initiate a divorce with Hee-joo and pay the former two million won as a ransom for keeping the secret of his marriage. The episode ends with the most shocking twist of the series where the caller is revealed to be none other than Hee-joo herself. A flashback shows how Hee-joo took the kidnapper's phone while escaping the place after injuring the latter. She later planned to get rid of her marriage of convenience by using the kidnapper's phone to threaten Sa-eon.\r\n\r\nIn episode 2, Hee-joo tries to call Sa-eon from the stolen phone, pretending to be the perpetrator but Sa-eon's phone seems to be switched off. She gets worried for him when he doesn't return home that night. In the morning, Hee-joo finds out through the news that Sa-eon's office has been bombed and Hee-joo's calls from the stolen phone are now submitted as evidence.\r\n\r\nThe episode ends with Sa-eon returning home with blood stains. He walks up to Hee-joo and tries to find out if she has the same red mole on her thigh that he saw in the photo the perpetrator (also Hee-joo) had sent him the other night. While Hee-joo denies any physical contact with him, Sa-eon tells her that it is important for him to know who she \"really is\".\r\nWhen are episodes 3 and 4 of When the Phone Rings out on Netflix?\r\nEpisodes 3 and 4 will air on Netflix on 29 and 30 November, respectively.\r\nHow many episodes are there in the K-drama When the Phone Rings?\r\nThe thriller romance K-drama has a total of 12 episodes.\r\nWhat is the duration of each episode?\r\nEach episode of the Korean drama has a runtime of approximately 1 hr. 8 min.\r\nWhen the Phone Rings K-drama episode release schedule\r\nSo far Netflix is releasing two episodes every Friday and Saturday.

Centred on a world-changing scientific discovery, it stars some of Britain\u2019s greatest actors (Bill Nighy fans, assemble), and tells the true story of some of Britain\u2019s most important scientists. Nonetheless, with the sheet mask peeling off my face as the tears came streaming, it became quickly apparent to me how deeply harrowing and relevant Joy is for the times we live in now. Not just for women or for scientists, it is one of the most important films of the year. Here\u2019s why.\r\nJoy - The Birth of IVF tells the story of the invention of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). It stars Bill Nighy, James Norton, and Thomasin McKenzie in its leading roles, and though the film has a predictable happy ending, I was grappled by some of the sub themes \u2014 especially those unveiled in the closing sentences.\r\nJoy paints a picture of a historic scientific breakthrough, but also touches on the societal scrutiny that was endured to get there. Through this lens, it explores themes of ethics, religion, and family, as well as the role of the female in the home, and in the workplace. As the credits came on and my sobs found no solace, I realised it was also a story of retribution, and of great relevance right now.\r\nOne Nobel prize and 12 million babies born as a result, where does IVF fit into religious understanding, scientific progress, and political agenda today? Our review for Joy paints a picture.\r\n\r\nReview: Why Joy will have you bawling, despite the happy ending\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936448\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Netflix[\/caption]\r\nA predictable plot, an unpredictable premise\r\nThomasin McKenzie plays Jean Purdy, a young nurse who works as a lab manager alongside biologist Dr Robert \u2018Bob\u2019 Edwards, played by James Norton. Together with obstetrician Dr Patrick Steptoe, played by Bill Nighy, the plot of the film revolves around the discovery and medical establishment of IVF treatment. Underlined multiple times throughout the film, its invention stems from a need to combat infertility in women, but also the deep \u2014 often unspoken \u2014 human desire for a child.\r\nSpanning over ten years, the journey to the creation of IVF is a tough one, both on a professional and personal level. The trio is denied funding by the Medical Research Council, and have to set up in a dingy space in Oldham, Manchester \u2014 a four-hour drive daily for Bob and Jean. Despite their determination, they are ridiculed and heavily criticised in the media, and Jean even gets ex-communicated from her church and family. It is a struggle that puts a halt to the project for some time, as Bob becomes discouraged and looks to other pursuits, Patrick focuses on retirement, and Jean, a devout Christian, searches for moral ground as she battles her own infertility.\r\nNonetheless, Joy has a happy ending, as the birth of Louise Joy Brown marks the very first of many IVF babies born into the world today. The photo of the three scientists holding the newborn kickstarted the water works for me, even though I knew the birth would be a success. That\u2019s the thing with Joy: there is a lingering, oddly somber tone about the film, as it peels back the layers of what this kind of innovation really means.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936446\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Netflix[\/caption]\r\nMajor themes of love, loss, and losing one\u2019s way\r\nDespite knowing the end result, I found myself on edge for most of Joy. I felt the fear, the anxiety, and the frustration with every drop of the pipette. Especially during current times, it is a familiar vulnerability.\r\nJean\u2019s mother refuses to look at her, until and unless she drops the experiments, even as she lies on her death bed. Bob is nicknamed \u2018Dr Frankenstein,\u2019 and likened to a nazi doctor in a live television interview. Nurses face bribery for information, personal relationships fall apart, and some mothers have to come to terms with a sad and solemn fate.\r\nYes, Joy is about a momentous and historic invention, but it is also sparking debate on how we treat science and scientific advancement. It is causing us to rethink our spiritual or religious standing, and it lifts a mirror to current issues around women\u2019s rights around the globe.\r\nNonetheless, for Joy, logic and reason (call it science) prevail. As Jean Purdy puts it, \u201cHow do you feel about spectacles and false teeth? You'd rather people be blind or unable to eat anything but soup? That's what God wants, is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936455\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Netflix[\/caption]\r\nSetting, cinematography, and the \u201caha\u201d moment\r\nThere are many other notable quotes in Joy, and often I found myself pointing at the screen in agreement. Against the cold, miserable setting of Oldham hospital (\"the decor's terrible\"), and to a soundtrack that underpinned every emotion on the screen, the film manages to evoke a sense of intimacy, until it breaks at the very last frame.\r\nWhether it\u2019s Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles or Yes We Can Can by Lee Dorsey, the film manages to stir emotion at all the right moments. The most impactful, naturally, is the history-changing birth at the very end. For a few minutes, the world feels a much, much brighter place, and the viewer revels in the wonders of science and perseverance, at what feels like the brink of revolution. Nonetheless, as the scenes with McKenzie, Norton, and Nighy came to a close, I completely lost it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936449\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Netflix[\/caption]\r\nJoy ends with photos of the real-life Jean Purdy, Robert Edwards, and Patrick Steptoe, against the gut-wrenching soundtrack of 500 Miles. Alongside these images, a text explains that Purdy\u2019s name was not included on the plaque commemorating the inventors of IVF, despite her obvious contribution. Edwards petitioned for her name to be included for years, and finally saw this come into fruition in 2015, a mere 9 years ago. Sadly, Purdy had passed away in 1985, at the age of 39, from cancer, and never lived to see this day. The last living member of the trio, Edwards was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in 2010.\r\nThe final slide reads that over 12 million babies have been conceived and born thanks to IVF treatment. Your heart aches for Jean Purdy, who was never properly credited for her work, and her being a woman feels like a second stab to the issue. Still,\u00a0there is a sense of retribution in the making of this film, and warmly, it opens and closes with Bob's voice reading a tribute to her. Thus, though Joy is set in the 1960s and 1970s, it still feels highly relevant today.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936453\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Netflix[\/caption]\r\n\u201cWe are here to give women a choice. Every choice.\u201d\r\nI did not go into this movie with the intention of writing a review. As mentioned, I played it out of simple curiosity, manoeuvring a wet Korean collagen mask as the opening credits came on. It was meant to be casual Sunday viewing, but I should have known better. Fittingly a feminist quote by Carol Hanisch comes to mind: the personal is political.\r\nMany people involved in the making of Joy have had experience with IVF. Similarly, I watched the film thinking of my own friends and family who have had babies through this process. It echoed even louder when I thought about the threat to our reproductive rights in some countries, and the declining availability of IVF treatment in others. Though the film is a historic dramatisation set almost 60 years ago, it touches on a fragile subject with much feeling, and shows there can be hope and advancement \u2014 even if it comes with ample debate. The timing is impeccable, and the urgency is necessary.\r\nDelivered by the brilliant Matron Muriel (Tanya Moodie), there is a quote from\u00a0Joy that stayed long with me after finishing the film. It happens to be about abortion, but no matter the year or the circumstance, it is important to repeat it. \u201cWe are here to give women choice. Every choice. That\u2019s all that matters to me, and it should be all that matters to you.\u201d\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Qoyn5BCm37o\r\nJoy - The birth of IVF was released on 22 November 2024, and is now streaming on Netflix.

Here are some of the best reactions and memes on the internet to Wicked.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been more than 20 years since Wicked premiered on Broadway, and finally, the movie adaptation has been released into the world. Film adaptations of musicals are a hit-or-miss so it can be forgiven that the movie took a while, but what won\u2019t be forgiven is if the movie turned out to be bad. Thankfully, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case and everyone is raving about Jon Chu\u2019s film. Not only are they raving about but many are claiming that, well, something isn\u2019t the same after watching the movie.\r\n\r\nWith the movie\u2019s opening weekend now past us, we take a look at some of the best reactions and memes on the internet to Wicked.\u00a0\r\n\r\n[Hero image: Universal Studios]\r\nThe best reactions and memes on the internet to Wicked\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936411\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"676\"] Image credit: Universal Studios[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAdapted from the musical of the same name by Stephen Schwartz, Wicked tells a revisionist tale of The Wizard of Oz and revolves around Elphaba and Galinda, both of whom would later become the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good respectively. The two characters are played by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande who have also been going viral for being emotional in almost every interview they\u2019ve given for the press tour of the film. There are those who made fun of it at first but once you\u2019ve seen the movie, it\u2019s evident why the both of them tear up talking about their characters.\r\n\r\nAnd the people of the internet share the same sentiments, it seems. So many people have been posting on socials of how wrecked they are coming out of the theatre. Those sporting Elphaba\u2019s green hue find their makeup streaked with tears. \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d is set to annihilate everyone\u2019s Spotify Wrapped. And as per usual, people are swooning over Jonathan Bailey who plays Fiyero.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThese are some of the best reactions to Wicked on the internet.

The film starring Bill Nighy is set to spark debate -- and joy. Here's how and why.\r\n\r\nThe makers of a new film about the British pioneers of IVF hope it highlights the \"fragile\" status of fertility treatment, with perceived threats in places like the United States and dwindling availability in the UK.\r\n\r\nJoy, released Friday on Netflix, chronicles the sustained and wide-ranging opposition that a trio of UK scientists faced while pioneering the then-highly contentious in vitro fertilisation treatment in the late 1960s and '70s.\r\nWhy Joy - The Birth of IVF is such an important film right now\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Qoyn5BCm37o\r\n\r\nFeaturing Love Actually star Bill Nighy, James Norton and Thomasin McKenzie, it tracks their struggles in the face of a media- and church-led backlash, which culminated in the successful 1978 birth of Louise Joy Brown.\r\n\r\nBrown, the world's first baby born through IVF, is now 46 and told AFP she welcomes the film, which gives the trio \"the recognition that they all deserve\".\r\n\r\nBut despite more than 10 million IVF births since hers, the film's release comes with fertility treatment increasingly attacked by some US conservatives and legal efforts to curb its use gaining traction.\r\n\r\nReligious and cultural conservatism in other countries, including in Europe, and stretched public healthcare finances have seen its availability increasingly limited.\r\n\r\nFor the stars and creators of Joy, that all makes their movie set five decades ago as relevant as ever.\r\n\r\n\"We sit on the shoulders of many, many people who have given a lot and for us to be 50 years later at a place where that progress is incredibly fragile is very, very scary,\" Norton told AFP in a recent interview.\r\n\r\n\"That's why this film is so fortuitously important.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA world-changing procedure\r\nDirector Ben Taylor, who has two children conceived through IVF, said the filmmakers wanted \"to celebrate and tell the story of the origin of this world-changing procedure\" rather than focus on contemporary controversies.\r\n\r\n\"But our story is about opposition too. It's about fear. It's about ignorance and the people that were trying to get in the way of something that was only being developed purely for good, purely to give families hope,\" he explained.\r\n\r\n\"So if it holds up a mirror to that similar conversation now, I would hope it proves the same.\"\r\n\r\nWith a taut script, humour and uplifting soundtrack -- which opens with The Beatles' \"Here Comes the Sun\" -- Joy turns a potentially dry tale of scientific discovery into a funny and heartwarming story.\r\n\r\nIts makers opted to tell it through Jean Purdy (played by McKenzie), a nurse and embryologist whose pivotal role in pioneering IVF was long overlooked.\r\n\r\nHer name was only added to a blue plaque at the northern English hospital where the team laboured for years in 2015.\r\n\r\nFor four decades prior to that, the plaque had only honoured her male colleagues, 2010 Nobel Prize for medicine laureate Robert Edwards (Norton) and Patrick Steptoe (Nighy).\r\n\r\nPurdy's airbrushing from recognition is what first attracted Nighy to the role.\r\n\r\n\"It was another opportunity to put a bomb under the male tendency to dismiss women's contribution to anything,\" he explained.\r\n\r\n\"There are many, many cases, from DNA to IVF.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJoy - The Birth of IVF as a highly emotional journey\r\nIn addition to Taylor, a number of other people involved in Joy had direct experience of using IVF to conceive, making the filmmaking process highly emotional.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of personal experience has gone into this movie, both in the writing and the making,\" noted Norton. \"It was evident on the page -- I cried when I read it.\"\r\n\r\nHusband and wife co-writers Jack Thorne and Rachel Mason, who went through seven rounds of\u00a0IVF\u00a0before welcoming their son, hope the film will raise awareness about the treatment's decreasingly mass availability in Britain.\r\n\r\nMason said the country's cash-strapped National Health Service increasingly rations access, so it was now down to \"where you live or how much money you have\".\r\n\r\n\"The people that get to do IVF now are the people that can afford to do it,\" echoed Thorne.\r\n\r\n\"It's wrong... and hopefully this film poses the question about how we feel as a society about it.\"\r\n\r\nBrown noted that that went against the ethos of the pioneering scientists' she owes her life to.\r\n\r\nShe grew up knowing the trio, likening them to \"a big extended family\", and forged a decades-spanning friendship with Edwards in particular.\r\n\r\nHe attended her wedding and met her own children.\r\n\r\n\"Bob, Patrick and Jean wanted it to be available for everybody -- normal, everyday, working people -- and I agree,\" Brown said before last month's London Film Festival premiere of Joy.\r\n\r\n\"I think everybody should be able to have it.\"\r\n\r\nIn Thailand, you can watch Joy - The Birth of IVF on Netflix.\r\n\r\nThis story is published via AFP Relaxnews.\u00a0"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Interview: Ronny Chieng and Chloe Bennet talk 'Interior Chinatown' and representation done right","position":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/ronny-chieng-chloe-bennet-interior-chinatown-interview\/","description":"\r\nAhead of the\u00a0November 19 release of Interior Chinatown on Disney+ Hotstar, Prestige sits down with Ronny Chieng and Chloe Bennet in this exclusive interview to talk representation, a killer script, and the role of a lifetime.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 7 in the morning and I\u2019m fiddling on the computer, Zoom lobby prepared, requisite morning coffee surreptitiously located outside the frame, and questions meticulously typed out and ready to go. On the other end of the screen: Johor-born Ronny Chieng, whip-smart comedian, political commentator, senior correspondent on The Daily Show, actor, and overall funny guy with a reputation for unapologetic sarcasm. His co-star:\u00a0trailblazing actress, model, and musician Chloe Bennet, whose notable performances include appearances in TV series Nashville (2012\u00a0\u2014\u00a02013), Valley Girl (2020), and Married by Mistake (2023).\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite what must have been a busy day filled with media engagements and mind-numbingly repetitive interviews, the actors are convivial \u2014 Chieng takes the opportunity to greet me with a Malaysian flourish, calling out \u2018Apa khabar!\u2019 (how do you do?) with the comforting cadence of an undeniable \u2018anak Malaysia\u2019.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ice broken, we get down to the details.\u00a0There\u2019s just so much to talk about, and not quite enough time to get through it all. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth Chieng and Bennet have long assimilated into Hollywood, rocking up acting credits spanning television and the silver screen alike. They\u2019re both Marvel alumni \u2014 Chieng notably appeared as Jon Jon in\u00a0Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\u00a0(2021), while Bennet held a long-term role as Daisy 'Skye' Johnson in Marvel\u2019s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. from 2013 to 2020.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRonny Chieng and Chloe Bennet of Interior Chinatown talk representation and performative tokenism in Prestige exclusive interview\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now assumed places of pride among Hollywood\u2019s top Asian\u00a0stars, both Chieng and Bennet \u2014 who came from vastly different backgrounds \u2014 nonetheless tread the subject of representation with refreshing candour.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking on how casting decisions have trended in the post representation era, Bennet jokes, \u201cFor me personally, it was like \u2018hmm you\u2019re too Asian\u2019 [before], and now \u2018You are not Asian enough\u2019.\u201d And it\u2019s true. In the earliest days of her career, the actress \u2014 whose birth surname is Wang \u2014 faced difficulty booking roles. It wasn\u2019t until she changed her name from Wang to Bennet that her prospects improved. \u201cNow, people are like, we want to see the diversity and have it be obvious. It feels more performative in a way.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUS actress Chloe Bennet arrives for the premiere of Hulu's Interior Chinatown at the Linwood Dunn Theater in Los Angeles on November 13 2024.

It\u2019s not a fight that will be fixed overnight, but any means, but it is interesting to see the progress that we\u2019ve made.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile his experience in comedy has differed from Bennet\u2019s, Chieng heartily agrees, recalling some of Hollywood\u2019s top Asian-led hits \u2014 many of which he appeared in.\u00a0\u201cI think over the last five years, I think there\u2019s been proven original IP with non-white people that\u2019s really helped. You know, proof of concept commercially and creatively.\"\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohor-born Ronny Chieng, pictured with Interior Chinatown co-star Jimmy O. Yang, has become a familiar face in Hollywood thanks to strategic career moves, movie appearances, and more. (Image: Olivia Wong\/Getty Images for Hawaiian International Film Festival)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike Bennet, Chieng holds no love for the performative aspect of representation. \u201cI think there\u2019s also been a lot of like, tokenism and shoving people into things, and tail wagging a dog a bit, in terms of diversity, but [then] forgetting about [also] telling a great story.\u201d Notably, Chieng is of the belief that the story should always come first \u2014 and for good reason. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of the writer\u2019s strike, there is an undeniable impetus in Hollywood to produce less, but also, to improve on the quality of the productions making it through the door.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Interior Chinatown is concerned, Chieng is hopeful. \u201cThis is a very cool story! It doesn\u2019t matter about the race thing \u2014\u00a0it's almost, in my opinion, kind of irrelevant, you know? It\u2019s a cool story, it\u2019s about TV, it\u2019s about society, and it\u2019s very cleverly written. It\u2019s very mind-bending and genre crossing. That\u2019s what I\u2019m most proud about, about this project.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBennet concurs. \u201cIt does feel like real change has happened when we don\u2019t have to talk about the change anymore, or we don\u2019t have to talk about how it\u2019s Asian or something like that.\u201d That\u2019s not to say she isn\u2019t celebrating the wins. \u201cI think the biggest takeaway is that this is, at the end of the day, a really high-quality commentary on TV, on media, on society, and yes, on Asians and it happens to be through the lens of that. But aside from that, we\u2019re really proud of the work.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGritty realism meets satirical comedy\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterior Chinatown has its roots in the eponymous 2000 novel by author Charles Yu, who also adapted the novel for screen as its showrunner and lead. Yu likewise serves as an executive producer alongside several others, including hit Hollywood director\u00a0Taika Waititi from which we received The Mandalorian (2019 \u2014 present), Thor: Ragnarok (2019), Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), and Jojo Rabbit (2017) among others. Notably, Waititi brought his directorial expertise, comedic timing, and penchant for dark and quirky humour to the\u00a0helm for the series\u2019 explosive pilot episode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Interior Chinatown, Ronny Chieng portrays Fatty Choi, friend, colleague, and faithful sidekick to Jimmy O. Yang's protagonist Willis Wu.(Image: Disney+)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt its core, Interior Chinatown is sparkling commentary on the \u2018generic Asian man\u2019, forever doomed to exist in the background of greater things. Often relegated to the role of the \u2018Background Oriental Male\u2019, \u2018Delivery Guy\u2019, or other such stereotypically Asian parts, this generic Asian man, Willis Wu (portrayed by comedian and actor Jimmy O. Yang) nevertheless harbours grand aspirations to become \u2018Kung Fu Guy\u2019. Across ten action-packed episodes, Willis embarks on a journey of self-discovery, unravelling mysteries surrounding his personal life and family, and finally arriving at who he was always meant to be: himself.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Bennet, portraying Detective Lana Lee in Interior Chinatown has proven both familiar and unfamiliar \u2014 particularly surrounding its procedural aspects, or lack thereof. To wit: she\u2019s spent much of her career on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., which boasted numerous elements typical of procedural shows. While she initially has difficulty expressing the quandary, she nonetheless manages, \u201cIt was like a satire.\"\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is at this point that Chieng jumps in. \u201cShe has experience doing, essentially, a procedural show \u2014\u00a0in Chinatown, you\u2019re playing a character who\u2019s kinda in a procedural, but also understands that she is in a procedural.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor her role as Detective Lana Lee on Interior Chinatown, Chloe Bennet drew on her past experiences in procedural productions, turning them on their head for a satirical twist. (Image: Disney+)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBennet expands on that. \u201cTo be able to make this satirical think piece, and really comment on this genre... I think it was helpful that I have spent over ten thousand hours on a procedural show. I lived and breathed that for most of my career, so to get to do that in a way where, all of a sudden, I\u2019m stepped away from it, was really, really therapeutic for me.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChieng, however, drew on his years of performing to bring his character, Fatty Choi, to life.\u00a0In portraying\u00a0Choi, who appears to be the requisite sidekick, Chieng leaned into his iconic blend of sardonicism, sarcasm, and unfailingly Asian caring.\u00a0\u201cI think Fatty has a certain amount of cynicism in him. [In] his character arc, he becomes a bit of a performer on the show.\u201d To Bennet's amusement (and to my own), Chieng\u00a0adds,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s probably what I brought to the project, you know, it\u2019s experience with life performing and being a super cynical piece of sh\u2013t, and so... That helped a lot.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of his self-proclaimed cynicism, Chieng\u2019s career has unfurled with a great flourish. While he\u2019s worked with numerous high-profile personalities across the years, he nonetheless chomped at the bit when it came to accepting the role. \u201cWhen you get an offer on a dream project, you take it, you know? The people attached to it, Taika... When you look at the source material, how cool it is, the book, and the people involved in it, the company behind it\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Disney, Hulu\u00a0\u2014\u00a0you know it\u2019s going to be ambitious.

Set thousands of years before Denis Villeneuve\u2019s films, Dune: Prophecy follows two sisters who join a sect that would later become the famed Bene Gesserit, a sisterhood comprised of women with uncanny powers. Despite being set years before Paul Atreides ascends the throne, political machinations are already rife in the world, with one of the main players being Javico Corinno. Played by Mark Strong, Corrino is an emperor who finds himself having to maintain peace.\u00a0\r\n\r\nLifestyle Asia joined a round table interview for Dune: Prophecy to talk with Mark Strong about his role as Corinno, what he\u2019s learned in the role, and how practical sets informed his performance.\r\n\r\n[Hero image: Max]\r\nInterview: Mark Strong talks about playing Javicco Corinno in\u00a0Dune: Prophecy\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936058\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image credit: Max[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWho exactly is Emperor Javicco Corinno and how does he relate to Shaddam Corinno IV played by Christopher Walken in the second film?\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure if I'm totally honest with you because I was told that Javicco Corrinno was the first Padishar emperor yet his father was also an emperor so I don\u2019t quite understand how he was so I don't understand quite how he was the first one. But obviously Christopher Walken's character is a descendant after many years and different houses take power. By the time we get to Christopher Walken, his house is the one that's in power. I'm not entirely sure if he's descended from Javicco Karino or if he's actually somebody who's the head of a different house. But bear in mind, it is 10,000 years later so I can be forgiven for not knowing whether he's a direct descendant or not.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou have been a part of many cinematic franchises under your belt. What makes this one unique?\r\n\r\nThe vision and the fact that it's based on these thirty-something books. It's such a rich world that is incredibly complicated but fascinating. That's a great bedrock on which to build a series. We also have the movies that are one particular version of that world and now we have something set 10,000 years before, which is the same universe but offers a completely different angle. It just shows how interesting and multifaceted the world is that Frank Herbert created in the Dune novels. The difference between the movies and the series is interesting and bodes really well for the future because it means depending on how you turn the prism to look at this world, you've got lots of different versions of it that you can tell.\u00a0\r\n\r\n \r\nHow does the relationship between Corinno and the Sisterhood develop?\r\nThe sisterhood is fascinating. You learn about them on the world they live on, Wallach IX, and it's entirely populated by women and the Bene Gesserit are these nuns with supernatural training a whole new bunch of younger women. And you realize that what they're training to be is to become a truthsayer, and every house throughout this universe has a truthsayer in it. Anyone who's anyone has a truthsayer who can allow them to work whether the person they\u2019re talking to\u00a0 is telling the truth or lying. But what we learn is that those truthsayers are actually part of a network, almost like a spy network out there in the world, and the Bene Gesserit are pulling the strings from behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nJavico leans on Kasha, his particular truthsayer, but her allegiance, of course, is to the sisterhood, which is something that he doesn't really understand when we first meet them. It establishes itself over the course of the series and you suddenly realize that there is some skullduggery going on.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936350\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image credit: Max[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe series has a unique visual aesthetic and production design. How did that influence you as an actor?\r\n\r\nThe gorgeous thing is that the competence of the technical crew in Budapest, where we filmed most of it, is off the charts. They created these fantastic sets in three different studios, all of which were truly amazing. It meant that almost no acting was required because you were in an environment that you really believed in. I don't remember any green screens, in fact. That's what you want as an actor. You want to be in an environment where you don't have to worry about creating all of that in the imagination of the audience because you can see it for yourself so you can really believe in the character you're playing.\u00a0\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIs there anything you learned from playing the Emperor?\r\n\r\nWell, in life, you could argue how much do we require a fa\u00e7ade? How much do you actually reveal of yourself to the world and how much do you keep back for yourself? Do you manifest your insecurities? Is that how you go through life or do you wear a mask in order to mask those insecurities? Because the truth is we all have them but different people relate to the world around them in different ways. That I think is Corinno\u2019s burden. He's superficially the emperor and in charge but internally, there is a lot of self-doubt.\r\n\r\nI don't know, how much do you incorporate that in life? That would be the only lesson I could learn. If you're going into a room full of people, until you know who they are, maybe don't manifest your insecurities. That would be my advice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWere there other sources of inspiration that you drew from aside from the many books?\u00a0\r\n\r\nWell, he's a very militaristic character so I drew an element of that. There's a speech I make to a lot of troops at one point so he behaves very much like a general in that environment. The throne that he sits on at the top of the stairs gives an element of kingship there, perhaps King Charles and his coronation when you think of that and all of that pageantry. That seems to surround him as well. The environment that he's in, the futuristic world of the rooms, you just sort of draw from that. I would say there's a combination of things, also a kind of Shakespearean power, if you like. You know, some of those characters in Shakespeare whether it\u2019s Coriolanus, King Lear, or Macbeth. A bit of militarism and a bit of kingship.\r\n\r\nDune: Prophecy is now streaming on Max\r\n\r\n "},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"How to see Ava, Chiang Mai Night Safari\u2019s golden tiger","position":11,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/how-to-see-ava-golden-tiger-chiang-mai-night-safari-thailand\/","description":"Want to make an excursion to see the latest animal viral sensation?

It\u2019s a delivery filled with earnest emotions that truly lured in viewers. But in some ways, it\u2019s also a showcase of the actor\u2019s acting prowess. Now, the world is tuned in. If they didn\u2019t know Woo Do-hwan, they do now. And they\u2019re seated for more. In our interview with Woo Do-hwan, he takes us behind the scenes of filming the Netflix series and gives more insights into his character.\r\n\r\nTaking on the role of Heo-jo is the latest addition to the actor\u2019s colourful portfolio. His versatility has been eye-catching from the get-go: with the scene-stealer Seok Dong-cheol in Save Me, the charismatic Kim Min-joon in Mad Dog, and the dual nature of Jo-young and Jo Eun-sup in The King: Eternal Monarch. Beyond Woo Do-hwan\u2019s emotional Korean dramas, his acting chops extend to saeguk and action as seen in My Country: The New Age and Bloodhounds. And, most recently, the 32-year-old star accepted the challenge of portraying a terminally ill character, Hae-jo (his chosen name)\/Chae Seung-hyeok (his birth name). The character\u2019s bold nature and sort of \u201ctsundere\u201d persona stretch his acting abilities. It\u2019s a test to see how the actor can balance the toughness yet carefree nature of the role. But he has certainly made his case and praises have come for his incredible performance.\r\n\r\nFollowing Mr. Plankton\u2019s premiere on Netflix and riding on the acclaim he\u2019s receiving, Lifestyle Asia Hong Kong got to sit down with Woo Do-hwan for an interview. It\u2019s a conversation without the flashy cameras and jam-packed conference room. Just like the free-spirited Hae-jo, the heartthrob gets candid, taking us through the complex DNA of his character. He also touches upon his natural chemistry with his co-stars and his newfound appreciation for the beauty of South Korea, and gives a heartfelt message to his character. Find out more in our interview with Woo Do-hwan below.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936290\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Woo Do-hwan spills the beans on his experience filming Mr. Plankton. Image credit: Jiyeon Kim\/Netflix[\/caption]\r\nWoo Do-hwan gives insights into his character in Mr. Plankton \u00a0\r\nWhat attracted you to the project and made you want to be a part of it?\r\nI loved the message that the show embodied and I wanted to share that message with a wider audience.\u00a0 I think Hae-jo\u2019s free-spirited side was something that I've always wanted to express and try out.\r\nIn terms of playing Hae-jo, what are some aspects that you focused on and want the viewers to take note of?\r\nI want viewers to look out for how he really doesn't care about what other people think. He really likes to lay it bare and has no problem adapting to the situation. Sometimes, the way he speaks can come off as tough and makes him seem like a self-centred person. But I just want people to recognise that he's on this journey of personal growth.\r\nIn your previous role for another Netflix show, you had to work out and be on a diet. Were there any similar preparations for this drama?\r\nI didn't really work out this time since my character is terminally ill. So to me, it seemed like he would skip meals very easily so it made sense to keep him skinny.\r\nWhat about in terms of the dramatic scenes? Did you have to prepare anything to portray the emotions of a terminally ill person?\r\nI wanted to show how his condition was worsening as the show progressed. But at the same time, his condition is not something that exists in real life. It's not an official illness. So, I just wanted to portray a character that was heading to the end of his life. But I didn't want to depict him in the stereotypical way that we often see. Instead, I expressed it in a way that his body wasn't really moving or acting in the way that he would tell it to act.\r\n\r\n[gallery size=\"full\" columns=\"2\" ids=\"1936286,1936288\"]\r\nWhat was it like working with your cast members to build your chemistry?\r\nAll three of us \u2014 Lee Yoo-mi, Oh Jung-se, and myself \u2014 met up in advance. We did table reads before filming began and spent a lot of time together so that we could get close. Plus, we all shared the same love for the show, like everybody was so equally hooked and involved. So, naturally, we got really close just talking about the series.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Yoo-mi, since we were playing lovers in the show, we really wanted to express the chemistry that we had. Luckily, we had natural chemistry on set so everything worked perfectly. In general, the chemistry among the cast couldn\u2019t been better. We really got along at a deep level to the extent that we would understand what the other person was thinking without them having to say it out loud.\r\nYou previously said that the most enjoyable moment in acting is the spontaneity on set. Were there any moments during the filming of this series that you felt that?\r\nYes, definitely, there were a lot of those moments. It was especially true in the scenes with Yoo-mi this time around. We didn\u2019t really want to stick to the lines in the script so we improvised a lot and went with the flow. Also, since this show is like a road trip, there were a lot of montage scenes so we left it up to how things would turn out or unfold on set. It was an exciting experience to have.\r\nSpeaking of road trips, the drama takes viewers through various locations in South Korea. What were some of the memorable locations for you? Did you get a newfound appreciation for the beauty of the country?\r\nWhile we were filming, I was able to learn how we had such beautiful four seasons in South Korea. That was one of the best parts of the filming experience especially when there was the rice paddy scene in episode two. There were scenes on the asphalt where you could really feel the heat exuding from the screen. Then, there\u2019s the snowfield scene that we filmed among the mountains and even the ones overlooking the ocean on Jeju Island. We had everything from mountains to oceans. So, I was really blown away by the wide variety of seasons and backdrops that we have. And just to add, my favourite backdrop was the snow field at the end.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1936292\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Behind the scenes of \u2018Mr. Plankton\u2019 with Woo Do-hwan and director Hong Jong-chan. Image credit: Jiyeon Kim\/Netflix[\/caption]\r\nWhat universal themes in Mr. Plankton will appeal to the audience?\r\nJust like the title, the plankton is a microorganism that is very tiny but the show highlights that they still matter and that they're valuable to the ecosystem. So likewise, I want to send out the message to everyone that no matter how rough life may be for them, they still matter. Life may be lonely but they are still valuable.\r\nWhat message would you, Woo Do-hwan, like to give to Hae-jo?\r\nHe might already know this but I know that he\u2019s going on a search for a family. But he already has one. Instead, he should just look around the people next to him. He also shouldn\u2019t think that he\u2019s alone or that he\u2019s been abandoned by his family because he already has the people who love him the most around him.\r\n\r\nWatch the trailer for Mr. Plankton below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2018Mr. Plankton\u2019 is now streaming exclusively on Netflix."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"'Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born' ending explained: What happens in the Kim Tae-ri K-drama?","position":14,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/streaming\/jeongnyeon-the-star-is-born-ending-explained-kim-tae-ri-disney-plus\/","description":"One of the most popular tvN K-dramas of 2024, Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born recently released its finale episode with the ending essentially linking similarities between Jeong-nyeon\u2019s real life and Maeran drama troupe's last play, The Legend Of The Twin Pagodas. Is Jeong-nyeon successful in the last play's audition and does she become the new prince of Maeran? Here are all the details about the K-drama Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born, from its plot to the ending, explained.\r\n\r\nBased on a popular webcomic of the same name, the period Korean drama is helmed by The Red Sleeve fame director Jung Ji-in. Written by Choi Hyo-bi, the show focuses on bringing to the screens the glory of all-female musical dramas known as Yeoseong Gukgeuk, an invaluable cultural treasure of Korea.\r\n\r\nWith actors Shin Ye-eun and Kim Tae-ri playing protagonists Young-seo and Jeong-nyeon respectively, the story follows the life of Jeong-nyeon, as she joins Maeran Gukguek-dan and competes against her biggest rival Young-seo, to become one of the best female theatre artists in post-war Korea.\r\n\r\nApplauding Kim\u2019s acting in the series, director Jung shared in a press conference, \u201cActress Kim Tae Ri was simply Jeong Nyeon herself.

The final episode of the 2024 K-drama Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born begins with Chief Ko Dae-il showing up at the Maeran house with a few people to see how he can transform the property once he buys it. Meanwhile, Heo Young-seo learns that the Maeran might be sold out due to unpaid debt. She immediately asks her mother Han Ki-joo for help by asking for her share of the inheritance she received from her grandfather. In exchange, Young-seo agrees to give up on Gukgeuk. Later, Young-seo offers So-bok the money she received from her mother but So-bok, who is grateful for the gesture, declines it politely.\r\n\r\nThe next day, So-bok meets with one of her friends who tells her about a cooperative that can lend her money. So-bok gets a loan from the cooperative and pays off the debt. However, she still has to find money to settle the production costs.\r\n\r\nWhen Jeong-nyeon meets an upset So-bok, she tells her that they are performers and any place they perform on, will become their stage. She further explains that it doesn\u2019t matter if they lose the Maeran building, their passion will keep them going. Eventually, Jeong-nyeon\u2019s words resonate with So-bok and she sells the building to Chief Ko and settles all her production costs.\r\nDoes Jeong-nyeon become the Maeran prince?\r\nDespite losing their building, the Maeran troupe plans to put their best foot forward and get ready for their last play The Legend Of The Twin Pagodas.\r\n\r\nDuring the auditions, Young-seo and Jeong-nyeon choose the same act from the play. Young-seo puts on an incredible performance and the judges almost conclude that there's no point auditioning anyone further. However, Jeong-nyeon beats Yeong-seo and wins the audition round, finally becoming Ok-gyeong\u2019s successor and Maeran\u2019s new prince.\r\n\r\nLater, Jeong-nyeon gets a letter of encouragement from her friend Joo-ran, where she tells her that she\u2019s waiting to see \u201cPrince Jeong-nyeon become everyone\u2019s prince.\r\nIs Maeran's last play a success?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by \ub514\uc988\ub2c8+ \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544 (@disneypluskr)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the finale episode of the tvN K-drama, viewers see the Maeran troupe performing their last play, the Legend of the Twin Pagodas. It tells the story of two skilled pagoda builders Dalbi and Asadal, with Young-seo playing Dalbi and Jeong-nyeon playing Asadal.\r\n\r\nIn the play, Dalbi is jealous of Asadal\u2019s skills because the latter visualises his sculptures and creates magic. However, Dalbi merely carves stones. One day both the builders are ordered by the princess of their kingdom to make the best pagoda. During this time, Dalbi finds a way to break Asadal. He manipulates the latter's wife and lies to her saying that Asadal will marry the princess once the pagoda is ready because he has fallen in love with her. On the last day of the pagoda\u2019s completion, Asadal meets his wife, but only to witness her drawing her last breath. The play ends with Asadal realising that he might have given his all to the pagoda but lost everything in return.\r\n\r\nThe play serves as a direct parallel to Jeong-nyeon's life at Maeran. It reflects how just like the character Asadal, Jeong-nyeon was envied by her biggest rival Young-seo, and how sometimes, outcomes have been unrewarding for Jeong-nyeon even when she put her all into it. However, passion for the craft is what keeps Jeong-nyeon going, just like Asadal.\r\n\r\nThe play's ending serves as the ending of the series Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born. Jeong-nyeon\u2019s performance as Asadal becomes a massive hit. She receives a standing ovation from the audience. However, the best part for Jeong-nyeon is her mother Yong-rye and her sister Jeong-ja attending her first play as the prince of Maeran.\r\n\r\nWatch all episodes of Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born on Disney Plus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image credits: \ub514\uc988\ub2c8+ \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\/@disneypluskr via Instagram)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Meet Ava, the golden tiger cub in Thailand set to be the next cute viral sensation","position":15,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/ava-golden-tiger-cub-thailand-viral-moo-deng-chiang-mai\/","description":"From the slippery moistness of Moo Deng, we now behold a furrier cute phenom: Ava, the golden tiger cub of Thailand.\r\n\r\nThailand is on a roll with these adorable animals.

Through clever metaphors and dialogue drawn from real-life experience, it has brought a lupe to Asians in Hollywood. Here\u2019s a closer look.\r\nA \"meta\" detective series in which a struggling Asian waiter becomes the unlikely hero of a police procedural-style criminal conspiracy, Interior Chinatown satirises Hollywood's stereotypical treatment of minorities -- while also nodding to the progress the industry has belatedly made.\r\nThe new show, out on Hulu (Disney+ in Thailand) on Tuesday, is based on the critically adored novel by US author Charles Yu, who is of Taiwanese descent.\r\n\r\nHow \u2018Interior Chinatown\u2019 satirises Asians in Hollywood: Metaphors, irony, and real-life experience\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rZa42yttX7Q\r\nYu's 2020 bestseller delivered a humorous takedown of racism in US society through the adventures of Willis Wu, a Hollywood extra reduced to playing roles like \"Background Oriental Male\" but who dreams of one day being promoted to \"Kung Fu Guy.\"\r\nYu now serves as the TV series' creator and showrunner.\r\n\"I grew up watching TV in the '80s and '90s, and I just never saw Asians on TV. It's as if they didn't exist,\" he told a press conference in July.\r\n\"They existed in real life when I'd go outside, but they weren't somehow in my screen. And so, that sort of shaped me in wanting to tell this story.\"\r\nEven a decade ago, Yu's literary creation would likely have been ignored by Hollywood.\r\nBut in recent years, breakout successes for Asian American productions like Crazy Rich Asians and Everything Everywhere All At Once, not to mention South Korean hits Parasite and Squid Game, have proven the commercial appetite for diverse storytelling.\r\nHong Kong-born US actor Jimmy O. Yang, who appeared in \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" stars as Wu in \"Interior Chinatown.\"\r\nOscar-winning New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi (\"Jojo Rabbit\") directs the pilot episode.\r\n\r\nInterior Chinatown\u00a0is a metaphor for something greater\r\nViewers are introduced to Wu as an ordinary waiter at a restaurant in Los Angeles's Chinatown -- but quickly find out that he also appears to reside within a police procedural.\r\nIn these scenes, Interior Chinatown adopts the visual codes and tropes of a TV cop drama. Wu is relegated to a background character role, as the series' Black and white cop duo solve crimes.\r\nEven more strangely, unexplained cameras are shown filming Wu and his colleagues, reminiscent of The Truman Show.\r\nThe distortion of reality echoes the premise of the original novel, which was itself written in the form of a television screenplay.\r\n\"It's such a great metaphor for what it means to be Asian American in this country,\" said Yang.\r\n\"But at the same time, it's a universal story of someone longing to be more, someone finding themselves in their career.\"\r\nWhen Wu witnesses a kidnapping, twists and turns see this background actor take on increasingly important roles in the narrative of a criminal intrigue.\r\n\"He moves on to be kind of like a guest star. And then the tech guy, which, of course, I played before. So it really drew a lot of parallels to my own career,\" said Yang.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935863\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Valerie Macon\/AFP\u00a9[\/caption]\r\n\u2018You\u2019re just not white enough to lead, but you\u2019re not Asian enough to be Asian\u2019\r\nThe series blends English, Mandarin and Cantonese dialogue.\r\nAmong its characters is Lana Lee, a mixed-race novice cop, who is assigned a case in Chinatown by superiors who incorrectly assume that she must know her way around the Asian neighbourhood.\r\nThe irony was not lost on actress Chloe Bennet, born Chloe Wang to a Chinese father and white American mother, who in real life had to change her last name in order to land roles in Hollywood.\r\n\"My journey through the industry is so meta for Lana,\" she told the press conference.\r\n\"I literally was told at the beginning of my career... 'You're just not white enough to be the lead, but you're not Asian enough to be the Asian.'\"\r\nWu's best friend Fatty Choi, played by comedian Ronny Chieng (The Daily Show), provides a hilarious counterpoint to audiences' pre-conceived notions of Asians as the \"model minority.\"\r\nA video game-addicted stoner, Choi aggressively lectures the restaurant's demanding white customers that they are \"not the center of the universe.\"\r\n\"To do something this cool, this meta, this mind-bending and smart -- social commentary, but not hitting people over the head with it... this is the stuff that you only dream of being able to do,\" he said.\r\nInterior Chinatown will be available to stream on Disney+Hotstar in Thailand.\r\nThis story is published via AFP Relaxnews.

The excitement from her fans, the Swifties, has turned each concert into a massive success, contributing to her incredible net worth. By October 2023, she officially became a self-made billionaire and the richest female musician in the world as of 2024.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Travis Kelce, a three-time Super Bowl champion, has built a significant fortune himself. As of 2024, Swift's net worth, according to Forbes, has soared to a whopping USD 1.6 billion thanks to chart-topping albums, sold-out tours and savvy business ventures. Meanwhile, Kelce's successful NFL career and charming persona have landed him lucrative endorsement deals and broadcasting contracts, bringing his net worth to USD 90 million.\r\n\r\nSo, Taylor Swift and Tavis Kelce's combined net worth as of 2024 is estimated to be USD 1.59 billion.\r\nTravis Kelce\u2019s earnings and salary in 2024\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935738\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"645\"] Image: Courtesy Travis Kelce\/@killatrav via Instagram[\/caption]\r\n\r\nA major chunk of Travis Kelce's net worth comes from his career as a National Football League player. Over his first decade in the NFL, he racked up nearly USD 80 million in salary. Back in 2013, he signed a four-year contract worth USD 3.12 million with The Kansas City Chiefs, and then in 2016, he extended that deal for five more years at USD 46 million. That extension included USD 22 million guaranteed, averaging out to about USD 14 million a year.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFast forward to late April 2024, and Kelce inked a two-year extension with the Chiefs for USD 34.25 million. This new deal averages USD 17.125 million annually and will push his career earnings past the USD 100 million mark when his contract gets over in late 2025.\u00a0\r\n\r\nEven if he decides to retire early, his impressive career has already made him one of the richest tight ends in NFL history.\r\n\r\nLooking specifically at 2024, Kelce's base salary is USD 5,750,000. Additionally, he\u2019s got a USD 11,000,000 roster bonus and a USD 250,000 workout bonus, bringing his total average salary for the year to USD 17,125,000.\r\n\r\nAs Kelce, continues to shine in the NFL, his net worth is likely to keep climbing, but he might need to negotiate a better deal with the Chiefs to see that growth. And the tight end is aware. \"My managers and agents love to tell me how underpaid I am,\" Kelce told Vanity Fair, adding, \u201cAny time I talk about wanting more money, they\u2019re just like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you go to the Chiefs and ask them?'\" However, Kelce has his own reasons for not asking the Chiefs for a raise. He doesn't want to leave Kansas City for some extra money, which is something that a few of his teammates have done in recent seasons.\r\nTaylor Swift\u2019s earnings in 2024 \r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935740\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"806\"] Taylor Swift performing at The Eras Tour. Image: Courtesy Taylor Swift\/@taylorswift13 via X[\/caption]\r\n\r\nKelce has built up a pretty massive net worth and career earnings, but Swift doesn\u2019t have a set salary, and her income can vary a lot depending on whether she\u2019s dropping a new album, on tour or involved in other projects. However, her boyfriend\u2019s earnings pale in front of her.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCelebrityNetWorth (CNW) suggests she rakes in around USD 150 million annually, which is probably more than Kelce will earn throughout his entire time with the Chiefs.\u00a0Forbes also reported that Swift made about USD 92 million in 2022, showing that her earnings fluctuate significantly from year to year compared to Kelce\u2019s.\r\n\r\nThe \"Fortnight\" singer's rising wealth has increased considerably following the success of the first leg of her The Eras Tour, which resulted in USD 190 million in profit for her after taxes. She earned around USD 13.6 million per concert and with over 150 concerts worldwide, the tour is expected to generate more than USD 2 billion in ticket sales alone, according to a 2023 Forbes report.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour became one of the highest-grossing concert films, as the singer continued dominating music charts and streaming platforms with her multitude of releases.\r\n\r\nSwift has made most of her envious fortune through her successful career as a country and pop artist. She\u2019s sold over 100 million records globally and holds the title of the most-streamed female artist on Spotify in 2023, with over 26.1 billion streams. Her stadium tour tickets and merchandise fly off the shelves, adding to her wealth. Additionally, her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, went on to become the best-selling album of 2024 within 48 hours of its release in April. It became the fastest album to surpass 1 billion global album streams in history.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \u2018Taylor Effect\u2019 on Kelce\u2019s net worth\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time Swift went public with the tight end on 24 September 2023 to 22 January 2024, she generated a whopping USD 331.5 million in brand value for the Chiefs. This phenomenon, popularly dubbed as \"The Taylor Swift Effect\" by entrepreneur and investor Joe Pompliano, led to a 400 per cent increase in Travis\u2019 No. 87 jersey sales, via the Fanatics network of sites, including NFLShop.com. Some reports even indicate that this effect resulted in a 20 per cent boost in sponsorships, as noted by The Wrap.\r\n\r\nThe NFL's TV ratings saw a massive spike as well, particularly among women. They recorded the highest regular-season viewership from female fans, with a 53 per cent increase among teenage girls and over 2 million women of all ages tuning in since Swift started attending games, as reported by Reuters via CBC. This surge means more advertising opportunities both on TV and in stadiums.\r\n\r\nCurrently in her mid-30s and still at the peak of her fame, Swift is likely to keep climbing up in her career. At present, her music catalogue is valued at around USD 500 million, and that number is expected to grow as she continues to re-record her earlier albums to gain control of their masters and release new music.\r\nTravis Kelce and Taylor Swift\u2019s brand endorsements and merch sales\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935759\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"724\"] Travis posing with a can of Accelarator Active Energy. (Image Credit: Accelerator Active Energy\/@drinkaccelerator via Instagram)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nKelce earns USD 5 million annually from partnerships with McDonald's, Nike, Papa John's, Bud Light, State Farm, and others. In 2023, he appeared in more commercials for DirecTV, State Farm and Pfizer.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, the Kelce brothers launched a weekly podcast called \u2018New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce\u2019 which has seen immense popularity in just two years. In August 2024, they signed a 3-year, USD 100 million deal with Amazon's Wondery podcast service, which has further contributed to the spike in Kelce\u2019s net worth, according to CNW. Interestingly, according to Spotify, inquiries for \u201cTravis Kelce\u201d saw a rise by more than 1,300 per cent on the streaming service after Swift attended one of the Chiefs games initially.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to social media, Kelce has 6.8 million followers on Instagram, while Swift has a staggering 283 million. Although these figures aren't directly comparable, the tight end might benefit more from his Instagram presence through ads, as he engages in several brand endorsements. He also runs a clothing line called Tru Kolors Brand, and his podcast \"New Heights\" features merchandise that tends to sell out quickly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Swift is projected by Dow Jones, one of the most commonly followed equity indexes, to earn around USD 25 million in endorsements in 2023, thanks to her partnerships with major brands like Capital One, Coca-Cola, Target and Apple. She consistently sells out merchandise at her concerts and online, with venues opening days in advance to allow fans to grab T-shirts, sweatshirts, limited-edition CDs, vinyl records and more. In October 2023, Bloomberg\u00a0reported that Swift generated an impressive USD 370 million from concert sales and merchandise.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s TV and movie career\r\nThe rising net worth of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce is further boosted by their TV and film gigs.\r\n\r\nAlongside her music career, the \"Love Story\" singer has also dabbled in acting, making a cameo in various TV shows and films like New Girl (the episode featuring Taylor Swift was titled \"Elaine's Big Day\" and it aired in May 2013), The Lorax (2012), The Giver (2014) and Cats (2019) On the other hand, Kelce kicked off his acting journey with the 2020 series Moonbase 8, but he landed his first big role in May 2024 when he joined the cast of Ryan Murphy\u2019s Grotesquerie.\r\n\r\nThe footballer is also the host of the revamped version of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? on Prime Video, now called Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity?, starting October 2024.\r\n\r\nAlso, Adam Sandler revealed during an August 2024 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that Kelce will have a cameo in the upcoming sequel of Happy Gilmore (1996).\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image credits: Taylor Swift\/@taylorswift and Travis Kelce\/@killatrav via Instagram)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Kim Sung-cheol's net worth: Inside the \u2018Hellbound\u2019 season 2 star's fortune","position":19,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/kim-sung-cheol-net-worth-of-hellbound-season-2-star-career-and-more\/","description":"Theatre star and K-drama heartthrob Kim Sung-cheol has been making waves since being cast as Jung Jin-su in Hellbound season 2.

Thankfully, there\u2019s not much time left to wait as the movie is set to be released on November 22. But if you can\u2019t wait to, ahem, defy gravity then Starbucks can sate your longing for the wonderful land of Oz. In select countries in Asia Pacific including Thailand, Starbucks is releasing a number of limited edition Wicked merch from green and pink-hued drinkware to Oz-inspired Starbucks Cards.\r\n\r\n[Hero image: Starbucks]\r\nGrab these Starbucks Wicked merch when they drop this November\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935622\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image credit: Starbucks[\/caption]\r\n\r\nStarbucks is releasing an array of Wicked-themed stuff in Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, and a couple of other countries. Some countries will be able to enjoy two beverages inspired by the movie\u2019s two protagonists, Galinda (Ariana Grande) and Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo). Unfortunately for us here in Thailand, those beverages won\u2019t be available here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, what will be available is the Wicked drinkware collection. A selection of tumblers and gold cups are designed with Elphaba\u2019s signature witchy green and Glinda\u2019s magical pink. One that fans will love will probably be the cold cup emblazoned with \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d across it. Aside from the drinkware, a number of Starbucks Cards with Wicked-inspired designs will also be available. One of the cards can be mistaken for a transit card for the Emerald City (if the Emerald City did have trains and buses) while another has a Grimmerie-inspired casing and can also be a keychain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Starbucks Wicked merch is set to drop on November 20 just two days before the film is released in theatres.

Straight out of Sathorn, we hopped on a GrabBike to play the Monopoly Bangkok as soon as it arrived. Here\u2019s what you can expect from the board game, including every charming Bangkok touch from sticky rice token to street food tax.\r\nReleased in collaboration with the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), we\u2019re excited to see that Bangkok finally has its own Monopoly board, featuring many of the places we know and love. As TAT Governor Thapanee Kiatphaibool states, \u201cThis edition celebrates the essence of Bangkok, highlighting its cultural landmarks, bustling street markets, and luxury hotels. I am so proud to see the city captured in this moment through one of the world\u2019s most iconic games.\u201d\r\nEager to play and eager to see what is listed (and not listed) on the board, here\u2019s what happened when we ordered FoodPanda, gathered the gang, and played the game. After all, we wouldn\u2019t be true Bangkokians if we didn\u2019t already have an opinion on this.\r\n[Hero and Featured Image Credit: Kimpton Maa-Lai Bangkok]\r\nReviewing the Monopoly Bangkok Edition game: What\u2019s different, what\u2019s the same, and what\u2019s unique\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935360\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Kimpton Maa-Lai Bangkok[\/caption]\r\nHow is the Bangkok Monopoly different to the classic Monopoly?\r\nThe objective and the rules of the game are the same as in the classic Monopoly, though the board game does come with an acknowledgement that many players like to adapt and create their own rules. Fair play.\r\nWhat\u2019s different about the Bangkok edition is that you can own three things: a Bangkok location, a mode of transport (taxi, boat, train, and even plane), or an activity (Muay Thai and Thai massage). The tax spaces have also changed, and are labelled as \u2018Buy Street Food\u2019 or \u2018Tuk Tuk City Tour,\u2019 and you will need to pay the bank when you land on these. Interestingly, you can also pay the jail to get out of it, should you land there.\r\nMost obviously, the game board features familiar places around Bangkok, and definitely presents a wow-moment when you open it. It also comes with 6 new bespoke tokens, themed around Thai items.\r\n \r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935454\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Image Credit: Monopoly Bangkok Edition via Asia Books[\/caption]\r\nUnique Bangkok-themed tokens\r\nTo serious Monopoly players, the game begins the moment you select your token, and could determine the fate of your play. The classic edition features the Top Hat, the Battleship, the Thimble, and the Car, to name a few, and we love that the Bangkok edition features 6 completely unique tokens.\r\nThe standouts are the Tuk-Tuk, the Moped, and the Suitcase, as a nod to the travellers and tourists who visit Bangkok, as well as the Muay Thai Boxing Gloves, which come as a pair. It took us a hot minute to decipher the Mango Sticky Rice token, though it definitely delivers the highest charm points. The final token is the Backpack, which is the hardest to identify, but also pays homage to all the backpackers who visit Bangkok every year.\r\nWhilst the tuk-tuk was predictable, we were relieved that the game didn\u2019t dig too deep into stereotypes (no elephant token, phew). We would have loved to see a street food cart to further play into Thai food soft power, a nasal inhaler as a nod to our yadom habit, or perhaps a shout-out to the river boats and the sky train, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935455\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Image Credit: Monopoly Bangkok Edition via Asia Books[\/caption]\r\nBangkok Monopoly locations featured (and locations missing)\r\nThere are 22 locations featured on Bangkok Monopoly, though we won\u2019t spoil the game by listing them all. The most notable thing is that particular buildings get their own property card, while other cards cover an entire neighbourhood. As a player, you start to wonder what the more worthy investment may be.\r\nThe board depicts Bangkok as a very diverse city, from luxury hotels like the Kimpton Maa-Lai, COMO Metropolitan, and Dusit Central Park, to the Bangkok Art & Culture Centre, Central World, Chinatown, and Khao San Road. Did you go to school in Bangkok? ISB alumni will be especially pleased to even spot International School Bangkok in the game.\r\nThe most expensive location is Chao Phraya River (at 200M mortgage value), while the more affordable options include Khlong Lat Mayom Floating Market (50M), Benjakitti Forest Park (50M), or the White Flower Factory cafe (30M). Is it a complete checklist for everywhere you should check out in Bangkok? Not really, but it covers most of the areas, with special spotlights for some.\r\n\r\nWe started to wonder when the game went for production, given that the price of Talat Phlu (30M) must have skyrocketed following its mention in the award-winning How To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies. Equally star-studded, we think that Raan Jay Fai would have also been a hot ticket, as well as other food chains beside White Flower, like After You or MK Restaurants. Lastly, a creepy but curious inclusion would have been the famous Bangkok ghost tower, also known as Sathorn Unique Tower.\r\nAs a Bangkokian, the locations mentioned in Monopoly Bangkok start to drive your imagination for what belongs on the board. As a tourist or traveller, they offer good inspiration for what to visit (even hotels to book). Most notably, religious landmarks like temples or shrines are not featured, though we believe this is as a sign of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935357\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Kimpton Maa-Lai Bangkok[\/caption]\r\nActivities, transport, Chance and Community Chest \r\nThe most charming and relatable bits of the Monopoly Bangkok game can be found in the finer details, be it unique taxes, activities, or special cards.\r\nWe especially enjoyed the occurrences that came from the Community Chest and Chance cards. These include classic Bangkok challenges like pronouncing the city\u2019s full name (win M200!) or strengthening your property ahead of monsoon season (40M per house). The Chance cards are a bit more direct, and feature blessings in the form of a Mahanakhon Skywalk ticket (200M), social hour drinks on the house at Kimpton Maa-Lai Bangkok (collect 100M), or dining out in Chinatown with friends (each player gets 50M). The most wholesome card is definitely the one that asks for your contribution to city heritage restoration (50M well spent).\r\nIn between Chance cards, Community Chest cards, taxes, and property, you\u2019ll also find activities and transport. Players can \u2018own\u2019 the activity of Muay Thai (we assume a club) or Thai Massage (we assume a spa). Other players will have to pay rent when they land here. Transportation is also up for grabs, each priced at an intriguing 100M. This means that a taxi or train is priced the same as a boat or a plane, which is an interesting concept.\r\nMonopoly Bangkok highlights what makes Monopoly such a joy in the first place. Realism is not the name of the game. Let\u2019s be honest here. From the locations to the activities and transport, it is clear that when you play, the world is your oyster \u2014 quite famously so, if you\u2019re spending time in Bangkok.\r\nThe Monopoly Bangkok edition follows the Chiang Mai and Phuket editions, released in previous years. At the time of writing, the game is at Asia Books online and in stores, priced at THB 1185 per box. You can also play Monopoly: Bangkok Edition at the Kimpton Maa-Lai at CRAFT, Stock.Room, and Maa-Lai Library. The game is for sale at the hotel too, available at the concierge desk, at THB 1520 net per box.

But the appeal of the movie lay not in the scares, but the twist at the end: that Avni was not possessed at all and, in fact, there was no ghost, just superstition masking the reality of mental illness. But in the sequel, and now Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3, Manjulika is no longer a psychological manifestation but a genuine spirit. Here\u2019s all you need to know about what happens in Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 ending, as well as the movie\u2019s large ensemble cast, budget and release date.\r\n\r\nIn this horror comedy movie, Kartik Aaryan returns as Ruhaan or Rooh Baba, a self-proclaimed ghostbuster. We find him swindling people out of their money by claiming to get rid of evil spirits possessing their family members or haunting their houses. However, his pretty profitable career brings him to a new case in which he comes face to face with something he is not prepared to deal with an actual, honest-to-goodness ghost.\r\n\r\nThe ending of this movie contains a significant twist that makes you reconsider everything you have seen earlier. Despite a limp script and a characteristically (and unpleasantly) maximalist direction by Anees Bazmi, the movie is somewhat saved thanks to the superb cast featuring names like Madhuri Dixit.\r\nBhool Bhulaiyaa 3 ending explained: The truth behind Manjulika's spirit\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935397\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Kartik Aaryan in Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3. (Image: Courtesy of IMDb)[\/caption]\r\nWhat is Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 all about?\r\nBhool Bhulaiyaa 3 brings back Rooh Baba but I believe this is an alternate-universe movie. Rooh Baba encounters another Manjulika after the events of the second movie and does not bat an eye. Anyhow, Ruhaan is introduced to a down-on-its-luck royal family of Raktaghat, West Bengal ruled by Vijay Raaz\u2019s irritable king. Their ancestral palace is believed to be haunted by the several hundred-year-old ghost of Manjulika and is thus abandoned. They, instead, live in a sort of barn and are dirt poor (in one hilarious scene they are seen taking turns to squeeze out the last drop of toothpaste from a nearly empty tube).\r\n\r\nBut since Ruhaan is promised INR 1 crore by Meera (Triptii Dimri) and she has threatened to expose his deception, he decides to take the job. What is the job? To dispose of Manjulika\u2019s ghost in the palace so the family can sell it and become wealthy again. A priest (played by Manish Wadhwa) who claims descent from Rajpurohit (royal priest) of the kingdom says he needs Ruhaan\u2019s help since he can talk to spirits. He also warns him that he should not open a certain door until Durgashtami, behind which presumably Manjulika\u2019s spirit is imprisoned using a combination of a giant, familiar lock, holy spells and talismans.\r\n\r\nOh and then the priest drops a bomb: Ruhaan is a rebirth of Prince, Rajkumar Debendra Nath, Manjulika\u2019s brother. While at first Manjulika was the only child of the then king (Denzil Smith) and was going to rule the kingdom, the king sired a son from a servant \u2014 Debendra. While Manulika, then a young girl, feigned love for her brother, she hated him as he was going to usurp her rightful throne. She murdered him at one point in the future and in return, her father and the king condemned her to death by burning her at the stake. But she did not exactly go away. From a bitter woman, she became a vengeful, evil spirit. First, she murdered the king and then probably everyone else. The surviving members of the royal family have been living in abject poverty since then. And even though, she was vanquished by a ritual and a holy oil, she has not really gone away. She is still imprisoned in that room, biding her time.\r\n\r\nRuhaan, the priest says, is destined to end the reign of Manjulika as it was foretold that only someone with royal blood in their veins can destroy Manjulika once and for all.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6YMY62tMLUA\r\nIs Manjulika real or just a figment of someone\u2019s imagination?\r\nIt appears that she is indeed real. Things begin to go bump in the night for Ruhaan. He has fallen in love with Meera, who also seems to love him. But in one terrible nightmare, he witnesses her falling to her death. He begins to see visions of a ghostly figure. It gets to a point that he decides to run away as soon as he can. This is when the movie becomes a psychological thriller as it plays with Ruhaan's mind.\r\n\r\nThen he learns that behind at least some of his woes are the terrible trio of Chhota Pandit (Rajpal Yadav), Bade Pandit (Sanjay Mishra) and Panditayeen (Ashwini Kalsekar). It appears they were happy and content living in the room where Manjulika was supposedly locked up \u2014 nothing happened to them. To hide their malfeasance, they locked the room again, while making a hidden point of entry from a window adjacent to the door. Now they are trying to scare away Ruhaan and the royal family so they can rule over the palace again. But the door is opened way before Durgashtami and there is no Manjulika that anybody can see apart from a few scares that can be chalked up to overactive imaginations and the terrible trio\u2019s shenanigans. So, is there no Manjulika, after all?\r\nWill the real Manjulika stand up, please?\r\nAs they say, be careful what you wish for. As everyone is debating the very existence of a ghost called Manjulika (Vidya Balan), two contenders for the identity of Manjulika turn up. The first one is a woman called Mallika. Claiming to be a restorer of old heritage properties, she feels strange from the beginning (the phonetic similarity between Mallika and Manjulika should not be lost on you). It is not long before another wannabe-Manjulika turns up. She is called Mandira (Madhuri Dixit) and she claims she belongs to another royal family and is fabulously wealthy. She can buy the palace for INR 1000 crore, 200 crore more than what they expected. Ruhaan, Meera and everyone else is nonplussed.\r\n\r\nNow, neither of them claims to be Manjulika \u2014 not exactly. But their behaviour can be charitably called suspicious. They act exactly like ghosts pretending to be human. And Ruhaan is not fooled. When Mandira says she will not buy the property until Durgashtami (not suspicious at all), a new prospective buyer turns up. He says he can buy it right now and especially falls in love with the royal throne. When he says it will be kept in his drawing room, Mallika is unreasonably upset.\r\n\r\nLater, Meera witnesses her lifting the throne angrily saying in Bengali that it has always been hers. And then literally the whole cast of the movie witnesses both women laughing hysterically and a little creepily. Oh and Ruhaan either dreams of really seeing the two women playing a childhood game.\r\n\r\nThen, a second, even more, hidden and protected door appears after Mallika and her crew who are restoring the palace to its old glory dig deeper. It is in the basement. Since they have to sell the property, the royals ask Ruhaan to open the door and he does. And then all hell breaks loose. The mysterious events escalate.\r\n\r\nThe priest learns from his research of lineage documents of the royal family that the king had not one but two daughters: Manjulika and Anjulika. Now, it appears both Mandira and Mallika and ancient ghosts who are now free.\r\nWhat happens in the ending of Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935399\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Manjulika has an identity crisis in Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3. (Image: Courtesy of IMDb)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe priest believes he can perform the same rituals his ancestor (the Rajpurohit) did all those centuries ago (three actually) and produce the holy oil that will destroy the threat of both ghosts. But Ruhaan is still not exactly sure whether both or one is Manjulika (since there has never been a talk of Anjulika\u2019s ghost). After Mallika, hair loose, voice scary and eyes dark as sin tries to kill Mandira, Ruhaan using the holy oil traps Mallika in a fiery circle. But then, Mandira claims she is the real Manjulika and says they committed a big mistake not to trap her instead.\r\n\r\nThen, the truth comes out by way of a painting that was disfigured by Mallika to apparently hide the identity of the person. It showed a figure (a woman, judging by her clothes). But it is not a woman at all. It is the Prince, Debendra Nath. Since Ruhaan and others never see the identity of the ghost (he wore a mask that was left on the scene of her death by one of the men who burned him), they assume she was a woman from her clothes. But it was Debendra all along. He is the ghost who has haunted the palace all this time. He was a transvestite who loved to perform female dance forms and was probably trans-curious.\r\n\r\nWhen he was spotted dancing by his sisters, Manjulika and Anjulika, they said they would love to see a performance. But it was a trap. As he was performing, they invited the king to see him. He was appalled and ordered him to be burnt at the stake. As he burned, he swore vengeance against his sisters and everyone who wronged him, including his father.\r\n\r\nNeither Mallika nor Mandira are ghosts, but they were possessed by Debendra to make sure others would also burn them alive \u2014 so they would feel the same pain he felt. Mallika and Mandira are reincarnations of Manjulika and Anjulika, respectively, and have found themselves drawn to the palace their whole life. As Debendra is trapped, Ruhaan asks them to burn him. But they refuse, and instead seek forgiveness. Debendra, satiated, gets liberated (moksha).\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935401\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 is a dry retread. (Image: Courtesy of IMDb)[\/caption]\r\nBhool Bhulaiyaa 3 movie review\r\nBhool Bhulaiyaa 3 lumbers onto screens like a ghost with two left feet, dragging its dated gags and a needlessly convoluted (and yet simplistic storyline. The funniest part about this horror comedy movie is that Manjulika remains the go-to ghost for the overlords of this godforsaken franchise. I know they deviated a little this time, but Manjulika was still the selling point in the promos and trailers.\r\n\r\nConveniently, each movie is set in its own universe, with the only connections being Manjulika, the title and Chhote Pandit \u2014 essentially the franchise\u2019s version of a recurring nightmare. Yikes. Meanwhile, Kartik Aaryan, also known as Akshay Kumar Lite, seems to be trying way too hard, flailing about in a desperate bid for comedic charm. It\u2019s pathetic and embarrassing. What it is not is funny, unless it\u2019s a joke at the audience\u2019s expense. And since he is the lead actor, we see far too much of him in the movie.\r\n\r\nThe dance-off between Madhuri and Vidya (Ami Je Tomar 3.0) would have been nice had not for spectacularly bad choreography and even worse cinematography. At this point, it would be better if all the Manjulikas were left to rest in peace than have them resurrected every now and then whenever the studio finds itself short of funds.\r\n\r\nI did not hate the final twist, but by that time I was so drained by the unending parade of worn-out tropes and uninspired humour that any hint of surprise felt like a flimsy afterthought.\r\n\r\nThere are a few high points, sure. One feels nicely nostalgic whenever the ever-melodious Shreya Ghoshal sings \u201cAmi Je Tomar\u201d. Sanjay Mishra and Vijay Raaz do excellently with whatever little screen time they are given. But ultimately Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 serves as a cautionary tale: sometimes, it\u2019s best to let sleeping ghosts lie.\r\nWho\u2019s is in the cast of Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3?\r\nApart from Kartik Aaryan, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 also features Vidya Balan, Madhuri Dixit and Triptii Dimri, Vijay Raaz, Rajpal Yadav, Sanjay Mishra, Ashwini Kalsekar, Rajesh Sharma and more in the cast.\r\nWhat was Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 release date?\r\nBhool Bhulaiyaa 3 release date was 1 November 2024.\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image: Courtesy of IMDb)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"The ending of '1000 Babies' explained","position":25,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/streaming\/1000-babies-ending-explained-disney-plus-hotstar-neena-gupta-sanju-sivram-rahman\/","description":"We break down the ending of\u00a01000 Babies\u00a0and what exactly happened in that finale.\r\n\r\nThe Malayalam-language series 1000 Babies is a delicious treat for anyone who loves a good suspense thriller.

It follows the story of a retired nurse with a dark secret with serious sociological repercussions. This secret becomes a catalyst for a series of murders that leave the police baffled. Let's explore everything we know about the new series 1000 Babies streaming on Hotstar\u2014 from release date to cast \u2014 and unpack the mysterious ending.\r\n\r\nNeena Gupta plays the role of Sarah Ouseph, a retired nurse who lives with her son, Bibin (Sanju Sivram). She is a dishevelled old lady who spends time scribbling on the walls. She also experiences psychotic episodes where she hears thousands of babies crying. Meanwhile, her son obediently takes care of her. One day, she decides to tell him her dark secret. After listening to it, Bibin loses his mind and kills his mother. The ending of 1000 Babies\u00a0unpacks the distressing secret and its repercussions.\r\n1000 Babies ending explained: Unpacking the mysterious plot and anti-climatic cliffhanger of the Hotstar series\r\nBefore Sarah's (Neena Gupta) death, she reveals her secret to the authorities via letters. The secret was so disturbing that even the police decided to hide it from the public for over a decade, fearing the social consequences. The series takes a time leap of 12 years. Kalamassery Circle Inspector Aji Kurian (Rahman) solves a high-profile murder case of an actress who is killed by her writer husband. While solving the case, he stumbles upon the name 'Bibin'. He decides to dig deeper which leads him to Sarah's diabolical secret and forms a crucial aspect of the ending of 1000 Babies.\r\nWhat is Sarah's dark secret?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Disney+ Hotstar Malayalam (@disneyplushotstarmalayalam)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter getting heavily involved in the case, the only authorities who knew of the secret for over 12 years decided to tell Aji Kurian. Sarah confesses in her letters that she swapped over 1000 babies during her tenure as the head nurse. Due to her infertility, Sarah's husband abandons her, stripping her of happiness. While working as a nurse, she develops a twisted sense of pleasure in seeing parents embracing someone else's child. She continues to swap babies based on religion, gender and other reasons, changing their lives forever. She also swaps Bibin in the delivery room and later adopts him. While he was a smart child, Sarah seldom let him out of her sight. Hence, he lives an ordinary and anti-social life, wasting his potential and taking care of Sarah.\r\n\r\nSarah decides to tell Bibin about her sinister act and reveals his true identity to him. After hearing the truth, Bibin loses control, pushes Sarah and runs away. On her deathbed, Sarah writes letters to the authorities revealing her dark secret.\r\nThe secret becomes a catalyst for a series of murders\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935389\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Image: Courtesy Disney Plus Hotstar[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter solving the murder of an actress, Kurian gets curious about Bibin who constantly pops up during the investigation. Kurian's probe leads him to two different murder cases with one common link \u2014 Bibin. Unsure of his identity, Kurian sets out on a mission to prove that Bibin, along with his accomplice, is orchestrating the murders of the people who were swapped by Sarah as newborn babies.\r\n\r\nRenuka was his first target as she was swapped with him at birth. Before killing her, Bibin scrutinised her and judged if she was worthy of living the life she was accidentally given. After making a call, Bibin made an elaborate plan to befriend her and slowly push her toward her death. After killing her, Bibin developed a diabolical satisfaction of scouring the people who were swapped and judging if they deserved to live. His next target was Devan, a corrupt politician who misused his powers and manipulated people to his advantage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the police decide that it is in the best interest of the country to kill Bibin rather than arrest him. The consequences of revealing Sarah's dark secret to the world would mean catastrophic damage to society. Kurian gets strict orders from the higher-ups to kill Bibin and bury the secret along with him.\r\nWhy did Bibin send the letters to Marlin?\r\nJust when Kurian reaches a dead end in the investigation, Marlin hands him letters. She serves the evidence on the platter to him by revealing that Bibin is the sender. She further reveals she was romantically involved with Bibin while dealing with her abusive husband. Towards the end of the series, Marlin receives yet another letter. It is still unclear why she was receiving the letters.\r\n\r\nOne of the hypotheses suggests that Bibin wanted to be caught and hence, he sent the letters to Marlin. He knew she would report it to the police and successfully stop him from committing any more mistakes. While this explanation is not compelling enough, we would have to wait till the makers decide to drop the second season with a better explanation.\r\nEnding explained: Kurian catches Bibin in an anti-climatic finale\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935391\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Image: Courtesy Disney Plus Hotstar[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAlong with Vinod (Shaju K.S.) and Ansari (Adil Ibrahim), Kurian tracks down Bibin and his accomplice. Thanks to the letter, Kurian locates Bibin's next victims. However, it is soon revealed that the people in the letter are already dead. They soon reach an eatery on the highway by tracing one of the victim's phones. The owner of the eatery reveals that his tea master, Arivu, would often chat with him. Kurian decides to take Arivu with them.\r\n\r\nHis search leads him to Bibin who reveals his sinister tendencies and motives behind the murders. Moreover, he also confesses that the murder spree would continue even after his death. Conflicted by Bibin's confession Kurian decides to arrest him to dig out the entire truth. However, Vinod shoots him. Although we can see an unresponsive Bibin on the ground, given his importance in the story, we cannot be quite sure if Bibin is truly dead. Moreover, before dying, Bibin admitted that his death would not put an end to the murder spree.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Anzari takes Arivu to a secluded place in the car. It is not clear what happened to Arivu at the end. At the end of the series, we see Bibin and his accomplice with Sarah's diaries which contain all detailed information about the 1000 babies she exchanged.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that someone from Kurian's team was working with Bibin. The suspicion points at Anzari. It would explain Kurian's shifted energy towards him. Moreover, Anzari receives a text before he takes away Arizu, the boy who led them to Bibin. The ending of 1000 Babies is a complex one that can only be solved if there's a second season.\r\nA brief review of 1000 Babies\r\nFrom the unsettling visuals to the spooky performance by Neena Gupta, the pilot episode instantly gets you hooked on the story. The series skillfully maintains the plot's mystery, successfully creating a compelling anticipation. However, the second half falters terribly with clich\u00e9d dialogues and mundane subplots. The original idea of exploring the dark secret of the old psychotic nurse (Sarah Ouseph) disappeared from the plot. It was replaced with a stereotypical serial murder subplot whose only connection was being one of the swapped babies. The last four episodes dragged the narration by playing several unnecessary scenes.\r\n\r\nThe performances by all the actors, especially Neena Gupta, are the highlights of the series. They managed to pull in the audience despite the occasional falter in writing. The cinematography by Faiz Siddik is notable. It elevated the viewing experience of the series, majorly contributing to its thrill factor.\r\nHere's the trailer of 1000 Babies\r\n[embed]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TxGwF3p3_O8[\/embed]\r\nWhen was 1000 Babies\u00a0released?\r\n1000 Babies was released on 18 October 2024 on Disney Plus Hotstar.\r\n\r\n(Hero and Featured Image: Courtesy Disney Plus Hotstar)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Is 'Mr. Plankton' returning for season 2?

The show has been winning the hearts of critics and fans alike since its release on 8 November, which is understandable as it was one of the most anticipated Korean dramas of 2024. So, here's everything we know about the possibility of season 2 of Mr. Plankton.\r\n\r\nDirected by Hong Jong-chan and\u00a0penned by scriptwriter Jo Yong, the latter of whom is known for highest-rated romantic K-dramas like It's Okay to Not Be Okay (2020), Mr. Plankton's story follows terminally ill Hae-jo\u2019s (played by Woo Do-hwan) journey to find his biological father in what may be the final adventure of his life. He is accompanied by his ex-girlfriend Jae-mi (played by Lee You-mi), who after learning about her premature menopause, chooses to run away from her marriage with Eo-heung (played by Oh Jung-se), an honest man from a traditional Korean family.\r\n\r\nTalking about the main message of the Netflix original K-drama, director Hong said during a 2024 press conference, \u201cIt is actually hard to pinpoint a single message that the drama aims to convey, but one thing is certain: Everything, like plankton, carries inherent value and purpose. While plankton may be tiny and nearly invisible, it plays a vital role in producing oxygen, helping sustain life on Earth. The title suggests that everyone, no matter how small they feel, plays an essential role in the world.\u201d\r\nWhat happens in the last episode of the K-drama Mr. Plankton?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935160\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Woo Do-hwan as Hae-jo and Lee You-mi as Jae-mi in the show.

The ending of the series shows that while Hae-jo fails to find his biological father, he and Jae-ni explore Korea on wheels after the former reunites with Choi Yeong-jo, the man who raised him.\r\n\r\nIn the final moments of the show, Hae-jo and Jae-mi are playing in the snow in a beautiful location in Korea when Hae-jo\u2019s nose starts bleeding. He realises that his time has come and recalls how he always wanted to die under \u201cthe dazzling blue sky\u201d. The show ends with the lovers confessing love for each other and Hae-jo taking his last breath while smiling at Jae-mi.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs season 2 of the K-drama Mr. Plankton on the cards?\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, there is no official information from the makers about season 2 of the K-drama Mr. Plankton being in the works.\r\n\r\nFans, too, believe that the final episode perfectly summed up the stories of all the characters. Additionally, Mr. Plankton was released on Netflix as a limited series, which further lessens the possibility of a season 2.\r\n\r\nWatch all episodes of\u00a0Mr. Plankton\u00a0on\u00a0Netflix\r\n\r\n(Hero image: Courtesy Netflix Korea | \ub137\ud50c\ub9ad\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\/@netflixkr via Instagram; Featured image: Courtesy Netflix K-content\/@netflixkcontent via X)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"'Mr. Plankton' ending explained: Does Woo Do-hwan's K-drama end on a happy note?","position":27,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/streaming\/mr-plankton-ending-explained-netflix-k-drama-woo-do-hwan-lee-you-mi\/","description":"Hae-jo and Jae-mi, the protagonists of Mr. Plankton, go through an emotional rollercoaster in the finale of the 10-episode romantic K-drama. But in the end, does their love prevail? Here we bring you all the details of the Netflix original series\u00a0Mr. Plankton, from the plot to the ending, explained.\r\n\r\nSpoilers ahead!\r\n\r\nAnother romance K-drama from the writer of It\u2019s Okay to Not Be Okay (2020), Mr. Plankton is a tender but heartwrenching tale of optimism and a love that is impossible to achieve. When protagonist Hae-jo is obliged to deal with a terminal illness with only three months to live, he learns that grief is always difficult, surprising and nonlinear. As he embarks on his final journey of life accompanied by his ex-girlfriend Jae-mi, hopes, regrets, and moments of short-lived joy make his last days memorable.\r\n\r\nA Hong Jong-chan directorial, Mr. Plankton stars Woo Do-hwan and Lee You-mi in leading roles. While Woo is known for one of the most-watched K-dramas on Netflix, Bloodhounds (2023), Lee is popular for shows like All of Us Are Dead season 1 (2022) and Squid Game season 1 (2021).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the duo's latest release, Mr. Plankton, has been applauded by critics and fans for good reasons. The show will make you swoon more often than not, as a naive Jae-mi, initially unaware of her ex-lover Hae-jo\u2019s sickness, tries to stay away from him but fails miserably. However, the ending of Mr. Plankton, which poignantly explores the show\u2019s recurring question, \u201cWhy do tragedies keep happening to people whose lives are already pathetic?\u201d, is more likely to have you reaching for a tissue box.\r\nMr. Plankton ending explained: The cast and their characters\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935153\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] From the left, Woo Do-hwan, Lee You-mi, Hong Jong-chan, Kim Hae-sook and Oh Jung-se at a Netflix press conference for the show.

However, at the tender age of eight, his parents discovered that the clinic had made a mistake with the sperm, and Seung-hyeok was not his father\u2019s biological child.\r\n\r\nIn the last episode, a flashback gives an even clearer picture of Seung-hyeok\u2019s past. After his parents discover the truth about his birth, their relationship deteriorates. One night Seung-hyeok\u2019s mother asks if he wants to go stargazing with her, to which he says no. The next morning, police officials inform his father that she is no more and her car fell off a mountain, hinting at the fact that it could have been suicide. Seung-hyeok\u2019s father withdraws completely from that day and ends up ignoring all of his son\u2019s pleas. On his graduation day, Hae-jo asks his father to come to get him jjajangmyeon but when the latter doesn\u2019t come, Seung-hyeok abandons that life and runs away. He is then found by Bong-suk, who raises him and gives him a new identity, Hae-jo.\r\n\r\nIn the present, Hae-jo and Jae-mi are on their way to Gangwon to meet the fourth individual who could probably turn out to be his biological father. For context, Hae-jo inherited a rare brain disease from his biological father and only has three months left to live. So he embarks on a final journey to reunite with his biological father. Accompanying him is his ex-girlfriend Jae-mi. In the last episode, Hae-jo, freshly out of the hospital after his latest treatment session, informs a worried Jae-mi in the middle of the night that it would be too late if he did not meet his father soon and leaves in a cab. At first, it seemed like Hae-jo went to approach the fourth potential sperm donor but it was Choi Yeong-jo.\r\n\r\nThe duo spot each other outside the latter's house and Hae-jo, after staying away from Yeong-jo since his teenage days, finally breaks down while embracing his father. Yeong-jo hugs him back and takes him inside the house he was once raised in. When Hae-jo enters his childhood room, he realises that Yeong-jo never threw away his belongings and his room still looks the same way it did when he had left. Hae-jo lays down on his bed and finally feels at home.\r\n\r\nLater that night, Hae-jo embarks on another road trip but before leaving he pens down a message for Yeong-jo on his business card that reads, \u201cI'm your son, Choi Seung-hyeok\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Plankton ending explained: Do Hae-jo and Jae-mi reunite?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView this post on Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA post shared by Netflix Korea | \ub137\ud50c\ub9ad\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544 (@netflixkr)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last episode of the romantic K-drama opens with Jae-mi wandering on the streets of Gangwon crying her eyes out. For context, in the penultimate episode, Jae-mi learns that Hae-jo tricked her into believing that they were going to meet his biological father in Gangwon. Earlier in the series, he had promised Jae-mi, who has been an orphan all her life, that he would find her birth mother one day. In the last episode, he fulfills that promise. Hae-jo drops her in front of her real mother's doorstep and leaves, thinking it would hurt Jae-mi less if she didn't witness his final moments. However, Jae-mi is less concerned about her mother refusing to recognize her and more about reuniting with Hae-jo.\r\n\r\nShe calls Ki-ho for help but the latter advises her to return to Seoul. Meanwhile, Hae-jo meets Eo Heung, Jae-mi\u2019s ex-fiance, and the duo share a meal. He recalls his past actions and voices how he should have never abandoned his loved ones, be it Choi Yeong-jo or Jae-mi.\r\n\r\nHae-jo then reaches Seoul and reunites with Bong-suk and Jae-mi. He also promises Jae-mi that he won't abandon her until his last day in the world. Later, Jae-mi picks him up from Yeong-jo\u2019s place and the lovers wander around Korea in Hae-jo's jeep, going from one destination to the next.\r\nMr. Plankton ending explained: What happens to Eo Heung?\r\nEo Heung, Jae-mi's ex-fiance, makes peace with the fact that Jae-mi chose to stay with Hae-jo. Additionally, he meets his mother Beom Ho-ja one last time, before driving off to an unknown destination. Later, she calls him and encourages him to wander off and have fun. But he should come back once he starts missing her food.\r\n\r\nA few months later, Hae-jo and Jae-mi\u00a0get a notification of a live video from 'Heung the Drifter'. It shows Eo Heung, who now is a content creator, sharing his experiences of hiking through Geumjoengsan, a mountain in Busan.\r\nMr. Plankton ending explained: Does Hae-jo survive?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935155\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Woo Do-hwan as Hae-jo in the show. (Image: Courtesy Netflix Korea | \ub137\ud50c\ub9ad\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\/@netflixkr via Instagram)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nNo, he doesn't. Mr. Plankton ends in a bitter-sweet note, with Hae-jo spending his final moments in the arms of his one true love, Jae-mi.\r\n\r\nIn the last episode, Hae-jo and Jae-mi have the best time of their lives exploring Korea on wheels. Soon it's winter, and the couple go on yet another road trip. On their way, they spot a beautiful location in the snow and run out to play. Hae-jo dares Jae-mi to find a rare four-leaf clover and promises to stay at a hotel with her and not opt for a camp if she succeeds. She agrees and wanders off to find one.\r\n\r\nIn the next few moments, Hae-jo\u2019s nose starts bleeding. He realises that his time has come and gets flashes of his life. \u201cI want to die under the dazzling blue sky\u201d, he recalls. He then lays down on the snow, looks up to the sky with tears and hears Jae-mi running towards him while crying her eyes out. When she reaches him and holds him in her arms, he laments how desperately he wants to live and be with her forever. He caresses her face and smiles as his voiceover shares his final thoughts, \u201cYou are the last scene of my life. Well, I guess then I had\u2026a pretty good life. It was so much fun. Thorough and complete. I love you.\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore the credits roll, Jae-mi too confesses her love for Hae-jo, who then tears up and smiles at her for one last time. The scene then shifts to their jeep driving off into the distance.\r\n\r\nWatch all episodes of Mr. Plankton on Netflix\r\n\r\n(Hero Image: Courtesy Netflix Korea | \ub137\ud50c\ub9ad\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544 \/@netflixkr via Instagram; Featured Image: Courtesy Netflix K-Content\/@netflixkcontent via X)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Dua Lipa, you\u2019d love these street food spots in Bangkok, too","position":28,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/best-street-food-spots-dua-lipa-should-check-out-in-bangkok-jay-fai\/","description":"After her photo with a coconut inside Maxwell Food Centre in Singapore went viral, we knew we had found a kindred spirit in Dua Lipa. Travelling across Asia as part of her \u2018Radical Optimism\u2019 World Tour, the Albanian singer and songwriter has been sampling street food in Asia where she can, sipping plum tea, digging into laksa, and even asking fans for local recommendations. As we prep for the star\u2019s arrival in Bangkok, we had a few local street food suggestions ourselves. Radically optimistic, we hope you see this, Dua.\r\nArguably the street food capital of the world (fight us), we could not be more excited to see Dua Lipa in Bangkok. The Asia leg of her \u2018Radical Optimism\u2019 tour will have seen stops in Singapore, the Philippines, Japan, Taipei, and Kuala Lumpur, before she arrives to Bangkok on 27 November 2024. Clearly, this is a tough roster of street food destinations to compete with, so we need to get in early with the recommendations. Any true foodie plans their meals (and their stomach space) in advance.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/DCBmiiQTPCz\/\r\nNonetheless, while Singapore was a good amuse bouche, Bangkok\u2019s street food scene is arguably more vast and varied, covering different (and distanced) areas of the city, providing a mix of regional Thai, Thai-Chinese, Indian, and even Japanese dishes to savour. From the classics on Yaowarat Road, and the newcomers on Banthat Thong Road, over to Youtube-famous spice and Netflix-renowned spots, here\u2019s all the street food Dua Lipa should try in Bangkok. Unlike in her Instagram post in Singapore, she need not ask us twice.\r\n\r\nBest street food in Bangkok: The Bangkok food spots and Thai dishes Dua Lipa should try\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935244\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: @dualipa\/Instagram (left), Nai Mong Hai Tod\/Facebook (right)[\/caption]\r\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious one: Yaowarat Road (Chinatown) for noodles, crab curry, and oyster omelette \r\nThis is Thailand Street Food 101. Ask anybody where to go for a good Thai street food experience, and it is likely that Bangkok\u2019s Chinatown on Yaowarat Road will come up first. It\u2019s convenient because Dua and the gang can walk up and down this street, easily stopping for snacks like squid eggs with spicy sauce, pork satay at Je Aeng, or the indulgent Patongko Savoey (fried dough).\r\nStreet food restaurant highlights on Yaowarat Road include Guay Ouan Pochana for rice roll noodle soup with crispy pork, Jek Pui for Netflix-famed assorted curries, or Nai Mong Hai Tod for oyster omelette. We know Dua Lipa tried the famous chili crab in Singapore already, and we have a feeling she\u2019d love our Thai-Chinese crab curry at T&K Seafood, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935245\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Rong Klan Nuea\/Facebook (left), @dualipa\/Instagram (right)[\/caption]\r\nFor a coffee break nearby, Dua could check out Song Wat, and find our local favourites\r\nDua tried the famous plum tea (also bubble tea) in Singapore, so perhaps she\u2019s a keen coffee or tea drinker. Therefore, a trendy and storied street for Dua-Lipa-cafe-hopping is Song Wat, not too far from Chinatown. The classic to visit is definitely Song Wat Coffee & Roasters, though she may like FV BKK\u00a0 for its artsy interior, too.\r\nFood-wise, Song Wat is home to many local favourite restaurants, including Rong Klan Nuea for beef noodles, Urai for braised goose specialties, and one of our favourite all-round local Thai restaurants, Ega.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935246\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Jeh Oh Chula\/Facebook (left), @dualipa\/Instagram (right)[\/caption]\r\nNext up: Banthat Thong Road for the city\u2019s most famous tom yum soup, and what is set to become new Thai Street Food Central\r\nWe know Dua Lipa already tried laksa, so now it\u2019s time for tom yum. The most famous tom yum in the city is definitely found at Jeh Oh Chula, located on the street food haven that is Banthat Thong Road. Other highlights around here include Tek Heng Mee Krob for crispy noodles, Tang Sui Heng for claypot goose, and Elvis Suki, named after a fellow musician, for seafood sukiyaki.\r\nFor a tongue-in-cheek dessert, it\u2019s got to be 9\u201d Fried Banana, which sells 9-inch fried bananas with two scoops of ice cream. Yup.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935247\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: @dualipa\/Instagram (left), Jay Fai\/Facebook (right)[\/caption]\r\nJay Fai, for good measure (and for the world\u2019s most famous omelette)\r\nFollowing the slew of celebrities who have dined here before, this is the most obvious choice for Thai food Dua Lipa should try in Bangkok. Helmed by the amazing Jay Fai, Raan Jay Fai has been featured on Netflix, is long listed on Asia\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants, and has held a Michelin star since 2018. As a consequence, the queues to get a table at Jay Fai are long, but we have a feeling Dua Lipa could pull some strings.\r\nWhile she\u2019s here, she\u2019d be a fool to miss the famous crab omelette, as well as the dried congee, seafood drunken noodles (kee mao), and yellow curry.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935248\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: Jok Prince\/Facebook (left), @dualipa\/Instagram (right)[\/caption]\r\nCharoenkrung for hidden gems, and Silom for Massaman curry and Indian food\r\nWe saw that Dua Lipa visited a Hindu temple in Singapore, so if she\u2019d like to follow a similar route in Bangkok, she could head to Silom\u2019s Pan Road to Sri Maha Mariamman Temple (Wat Kaek). Directly opposite, she would find Krua Aroy Aroy, which is often described as the best Massaman curry spot in Bangkok. Naturally, there are also a lot of good Indian restaurants in the area (we like Sri Ananda Bhawan best).\r\nA little further along in the creative district of Charoenkrung, Dua Lipa could indulge in a street art walk, and stop by Prachak for roasted duck, Jok Prince for the city\u2019s most classic congee, or Tuang Dimsum for dumplings. These spots are especially conveniently located if she\u2019s staying on the riverside.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935249\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: @dualipa\/Instagram (left), Phed Mark\/Facebook (right)[\/caption]\r\nOver in Ekkamai, Dua Lipa can test her spice tolerance (hotter than hell), get the famous fried rice, and sip 50-year-old broth\r\nEkkamai covers a large area of Bangkok, so this one requires some dedication, and some sitting in traffic. The most famous soup on this side of town can be found at Wattana Panich, a spot that has been cooking its beef broth with Chinese spices in the same pot for over 50 years. Over at Here Hai, Dua Lipa will find the most famous fried rice in town, packed with crab meat and a smoky aroma. Lastly, if she wants to test her spice tolerance, Phed Mark is the place to be. The brainchild of food vlogger Mark Wiens, they specialise in a very fiery pad krapow.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935250\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: @dualipa\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\nOn the weekend, it\u2019s off to Chatuchak, mostly for thrift shopping, but also some light snacking \r\nWe think Dua Lipa would love a thrift shop find, so Chatuchak Weekend Market is a must-visit. The largest weekend market in Thailand with over 15,000 stalls is both a labyrinth and a marvel, and we have a feeling Dua would enjoy the vintage selection, or even cheeky souvenir shopping. Food is more of an afterthought at Chatuchak, so we recommend this location for snacking and sipping on fresh fruit smoothies, coconut water and coconut ice cream, and more mainstream Thai street food dishes like pad Thai.\r\nSure, Dua Lipa has a concert in Mumbai on the Saturday after her Bangkok concert, but it is always suggested to visit Chatuchak in the morning, anyway. Nighttimes are for dancing the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935188\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: @dualipa\/Instagram[\/caption]\r\nAnywhere: Stop for Thai 7-11 snacks, like the famous toastie, sticky rice burger, and Thai milk tea\r\nIf the star doesn\u2019t feel like going out at all, we hope she can at least make time for our beloved 7-11 convenience store. The most famously popular item here is not a Thai dish, but rather the ham and cheese sandwich, toasted for you in the store. A simple search on TikTok unveils hundreds of videos on this phenomenon. One [search] is all it takes.\r\nA close second is the sticky rice burger, consisting of meat between two sticky rice \u2018patties.\u2019 To wash it down, Dua could get Thai milk tea from the machine, or whip up her signature Diet Coke, jalape\u00f1o, and pickle juice concoction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935251\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image Credit: @dualipa\/Instagram (left), Birdies\/Facebook (right)[\/caption]\r\nBonus: Not really street food, but if Dua Lipa is hit with another caviar craving in Bangkok, she could try Birdie\u2019s, Mott32, or CRU\r\nIt\u2019s pretty clear by now that Dua Lipa loves her caviar. Posting the delicacy on Instagram, we\u2019ve noticed that she often enjoys a good old bump on its own, or paired the classic way on a potato or blini. Whilst she could enjoy a fresh tin of Oscietra caviar at most fine dining venues in Bangkok, if she wants to get more adventurous, she could try fried chicken and caviar at Birdies, caviar with Peking duck at Mott32, or caviar inside cream cheese churros at CRU (also a champagne bar).\r\nIn case you missed it, Dua, Bangkok loves to eat well. We can\u2019t wait to have you.\r\nDua Lipa\u2019s Radical Optimism Tour concert will take place in Bangkok 27 November 2024. You can get tickets and find out more at Thai Ticket Major."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Is 'The Judge from Hell' returning for season 2?

Here's everything we know about a possible second instalment of the supernatural Korean drama.\r\n\r\nDirected by Park Jin-pyo, known for the hit 2015 romantic comedy Love Forecast, The Judge from Hell is led by Park Shin-hye and Kim Jae-yeong, who play protagonists Kang Bit-na and Daon, respectively.\r\n\r\nSpoilers ahead!\r\n\r\nFor almost a month, the lead-up to the ending of the K-drama The Judge from Hell pondered what fate would have in store for lovers Kang Bit-na and Han Daon. In the last episode, viewers saw Bit-na successfully sending serial killer J (played by Kyu Han-lee) to Hell. Later, she made a deal with Bael (played by Shin Sung-rok) that she would only return to serve him in Hell if he allowed her three more years on earth. The show ended with Bael meeting Bit-na once again two years later, this time with a proposition from Lucifer \u2014 if Bit-na killed 10 sinners and sent them to Hell in the third year, she would be allowed to spend a lifetime with her lover Daon on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCould The Judge from Hell season 2 happen?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1934970\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Park Shin-hye and Kim Jae-young as Bit-na and Daon in the series.

However, with season 1 ending on a cliffhanger, fans seem hopeful of a second instalment of the fantasy K-drama.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest revelations made in the last episode of the show was that demon Justitia, aka Kang Bit-na, was offered another mission by Lucifer. Through the 14-episode series, Bit-na, who was initially a ruthless and unjust judge, is shown to have evolved after meeting the compassionate detective Han Daon. But the ending of the last episode raised an interesting question \u2014 would Bit-na go back to her old cruel self and accept Lucifer's offer?\r\n\r\nThe final scene of the series saw Bit-na speaking directly to the viewers and accepting the fact that she indeed was \u201ca judge from Hell,\u201d further increasing the possibilities of a season 2.\r\nWhen can we expect The Judge from Hell season 2 to come out?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a probable season 2 of The Judge from Hell follows a similar timeline as season 1, viewers could expect it to premiere in the second half of 2025.\r\n\r\nThe Judge from Hell is now available to stream on Disney+ Hotstar\r\n\r\n(Hero image: Courtesy \ub514\uc988\ub2c8+ \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\/@disneypluskr via Instagram; Featured image: Courtesy Disney Plus Korea\/DisneyPlusKR via X)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"'The Judge from Hell' ending explained: Find out if Bit-na and Han Daon survive Bael's wrath","position":30,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/streaming\/the-judge-from-hell-k-drama-ending-explained-disney-plus-park-shin-hye\/","description":"We bring you all the details of the K-drama The Judge from Hell,\u00a0from plot to ending explained.\r\n\r\nDeemed by Disney Plus as a \u201ccourtroom drama with a demonic twist\u201d, director Park Jin-pyo's The Judge from Hell documented a tense finale with a rather interesting ending.\u00a0 The show is led by Park Shin-hye and Kim Jae-yeong, who play protagonists Kang Bit-na and Han Daon, respectively.\r\n\r\nWritten by Jo Yi-soo, the 14-episode supernatural K-drama focuses on demon judge Justitia, who is sent to Earth to send ten sinners to Hell.

However, Bael had already made it clear to her that If she didn\u2019t release Jung Tae-gyu, she would face eternal death in Hell. But viewers see Bit-na choosing death rather than breaking Han Daon's trust in her.\r\n\r\nAfter the trial, she meets Daon at a bridge and informs him that she needs to leave soon. She then confesses her feelings, \u201cI loved you a lot Han Daon\u201d, before bidding him a final goodbye. She also admits that he is the only weakness in her life.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, A-rong, aka demon Venato rushes to Daon\u2019s workplace and informs him that Bit-na will soon be dead. Daon runs to her but in vain as Bit-na is already stabbed by Bael\u2019s underling. Daon finds her mortal bloodied body on the ground and rushes her to the hospital. However, soon the doctors declared her dead.\r\n\r\nInside Hell, Bael is not happy with Justitia for disobeying him and bestows eternal death upon her. However, Gabriel suddenly shows up on God\u2019s behalf and informs that because Justitia, as Bit-na, has been a fair judge, God has granted her a second chance at life by overruling Bael\u2019s command.\r\n\r\nOn earth, Bit-na wakes up all healed at the hospital and Daon cherishes her return. Later, the duo pay their respects to their neighbour Mija at her funeral. For context, Mija\u2019s body was a host for the angel Gabriel. After helping Bit-na in Hell, Gabriel returns to Heaven.\r\nThe Judge from Hell K-drama ending explained: What happens after Jeon Tae-gyu escapes jail?\r\n\r\n\ub10c \uc9d0\uc2b9\uc774\ub2c8\uae4c \uc0ac\ub0e5\ud574 \uc904\uac8c\r\n\ubc15\uc2e0\ud61c\uac00 \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \ubcf5\uc218 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740?\r\n\ud1b5\ucf8c\ud55c \ubcf5\uc218 \ubcf4\ub7ec\uac00\uae30\r\n\u261e https:\/\/t.co\/7yQxgC6wqF\r\n\r\n\uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 SBS \uae08\ud1a0\ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8 <\uc9c0\uc625\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628 \ud310\uc0ac>\ub97c\r\n\uc0ac\ub791\ud574 \uc8fc\uc154\uc11c \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4#SBS\uae08\ud1a0\ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8 #\uc9c0\uc625\uc5d0\uc11c\uc628\ud310\uc0ac#TheJudgefromhell #\ubc15\uc2e0\ud61c #\uae40\uc7ac\uc601 #\uae40\uc778\uad8c #\uae40\uc544\uc601 #\uc774\uaddc\ud55c pic.twitter.com\/0wqD9WJ5S6\r\n\r\n\u2014 SBSNOW (@SBSNOW) November 2, 2024\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter serial killer Tae-gyu gets out of prison, he meets his attorney, who was his accomplice in orchestrating the escape plan. However, Tae-gyu kills him and heads to the airport to get his fake passport. On his way, he receives an urgent call and learns that something is wrong with the passport and he will only receive it the next day. This turns out to be Bit-na\u2019s doing, who with the help of Mando, manages to lure him back to his vacation home.\r\n\r\nBitna then puts on her judgement day outfit and meets Tae-gyu. In her trial, she goes all-out with her punishment and shows Tae-gyu no mercy. She uses her powers to transport him into nightmares that feel all too real. At first, Tae-gyu finds himself in a jungle where Bit-na hunts him for sport and brutally injures him. Then Tae-gyu finds himself in Hell where Bit-na has his father, aka Satan, brought up to swordfight and the former is mercilessly slashed. Finally, the nightmares get over and as Tae-gyu begs Bit-na for mercy, she gives him the same treatment he used to give his victims and chops him up with an axe. She then conjures the Gehenna blade, stabs Tae-gyu with it and sends him to Hell.\r\n\r\nShe leaves Tae-gyu\u2019s mortal body hanging by a pole on the front lawn of his house. When the police arrive, they also find 14 coffins containing the body parts of Tae-gyu\u2019s victims that he had initially stored in a secret room in his mansion.\r\nThe Judge from Hell K-drama ending explained: Does Bael summon Bit-na back to Hell?\r\nYes, he does. After Bit-na successfully sends Tae-gyu to Hell, Bael meets her and congratulates her for completing her mission on Earth. He then informs her that she is to return to Hell and remain loyal to him as his sole heir. She agrees to it but requests Bael to give her 3 years on earth to make the most of her life as a human judge. Bael grants her wish.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Bit-na and Han Daon get their happily ever after?\r\n\r\n\uc11c\ub85c\uc758 \uc0ac\ub791\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\ub294 \ube5b\ub098\u2764\ub2e4\uc628\r\n\uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 SBS \uae08\ud1a0\ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8 <\uc9c0\uc625\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628 \ud310\uc0ac>\ub97c\r\n\uc0ac\ub791\ud574 \uc8fc\uc154\uc11c \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4#SBS\uae08\ud1a0\ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8 #\uc9c0\uc625\uc5d0\uc11c\uc628\ud310\uc0ac#TheJudgefromhell #\ubc15\uc2e0\ud61c #\uae40\uc7ac\uc601 #\uae40\uc778\uad8c #\uae40\uc544\uc601 pic.twitter.com\/RkCtlL9UGR\r\n\r\n\u2014 SBSNOW (@SBSNOW) November 3, 2024\r\n\r\n\r\nBit-na informs Daon about her deal with Bael and decides to enjoy her three years on Earth. Daon is content with anything she offers him and respects her decision.\r\n\r\nTwo years later in the supernatural K-drama, Bit-na, who was transferred from Seoul, is sent back to work in Seoul Central Court. She is happy to be in the company of her old colleagues and Daon. She also moves back to Hwangcheon Dong and shares a meal with her old neighbours and checks up on the families of the victims. However, her happiness is short-lived when Bael meets her at her office and in one of the most shocking twists of The Judge from Hell, informs her that Lucifer is impatient to make a final deal with her. In her third year on earth, if she manages to kill ten sinners and send them to Hell, Lucifer will let Bit-na stay on earth as a human for the rest of her life.\r\n\r\nIn the ending moments of The Judge from Hell, Bit-na informs Daon about Lucifer\u2019s deal. She expresses her discomfort at having to give light sentences to sinners during their trials so that she can kill them in secret and send them to Hell. But accepting the deal would mean that she can stay on earth with Daon for the rest of her life. The latter reassures Bit-na saying that he will support her in all her decisions.\r\n\r\nBefore the credits roll, Bit-na, who is on her way back from a hearing, meets a bunch of school kids. When they question her if she is a good judge or a bad one, she breaks the fourth wall and quips, \u201cI am a judge from Hell\u201d. This hints at the fact that Bit-na did accept Lucifer's deal of sending ten sinners to Hell once again, to stay human forever and spend a lifetime with Daon on earth.\r\n\r\nWatch The Judge from Hell on Disney+ Hotstar\r\n\r\n(Hero image: Courtesy \ub514\uc988\ub2c8+ \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\/@disneypluskr via Instagram; Featured image: Courtesy Disney Plus Korea\/@DisneyPlusKR via X)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Celebrities who have dined at Jay Fai (and others who should go)","position":31,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/celebrities\/celebrities-who-have-dined-at-jay-fai-and-the-ones-who-should-go\/","description":"With a Michelin star under her belt since 2018, it can be said that Jay Fai is a bit of a celebrity herself.

The 2021 sequel, Venom: Let There Be Carnage further cemented its status as a pop culture phenomenon with The Last Dance capping off the trilogy.\r\n\r\nOn that note, here\u2019s a guide on the correct viewing order of all Venom movies and where exactly Spider-Man 3 falls in the order of chronology.\r\nVenom movies in order of release date\u00a0\r\nFrom the character's humble beginnings as Spider-Man's nemesis to his transformation into an anti-hero, here\u2019s the correct chronological order in which the razor-toothed anti-hero evolved through the movies.\u00a0\r\n\r\n \tSpider-Man 3 (2007): First appearance of Venom\r\n \tVenom (2018): First instalment in the Venom trilogy\u00a0\r\n \tVenom: Let There Be Carnage (2021): Second Venom trilogy movie\r\n \tSpider-Man: No Way Home (2021): Venom makes a cameo\r\n \tVenom 3: The Last Dance (2024): The third movie in the Venom franchise\u00a0\r\n\r\nVenom\u00a0movies in order of chronology\r\nPiecing together this epic saga of symbiotes and superheroes isn\u2019t difficult since all Venom movies in the trilogy unfold chronologically. We'll also get to where the other two titles fit in the timeline in a bit.\u00a0\r\n1. Venom (2018)\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u9Mv98Gr5pY\r\n\r\nDirector: Ruben Fleischer\r\n\r\nCast: Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, Scott Haze, Jenny Slate\r\n\r\nRelease date: 5 October 2018\r\n\r\nIMDb rating: 6.6\/10\r\n\r\nSynopsis: Journalist Eddie Brock (Hardy) bonds with an alien symbiote who transforms him into the anti-hero Venom. He faces the challenge of thwarting Carlton Drake (Ahmed) and the Life Foundation, who seek to exploit the symbiote technology. As the unscrupulous Drake and his mercenaries close in, Brock realises he can harness his newfound abilities to assist the symbiotes and potentially save his cherished San Francisco and the world.\r\n\r\nAbout the movie: Initially, Sony Pictures planned for the Venom title\u00a0to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe alongside Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), but ultimately chose to separate the film series from Spider-Man. The narrative draws inspiration from the comic book miniseries Venom: Lethal Protector (1993) and the Planet of the Symbiotes (1995) story arc. \r\n\r\nAlthough the film received mostly negative reviews from critics, Hardy's performance garnered praise, leading it to become the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2018, with earnings exceeding USD 856 million globally. Interestingly, Hardy accepted the role partly to delight his son, Louis Thomas Hardy, who is a fan of Venom.\r\n\r\nWatch Venom on Netflix\r\n2. Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021)\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-FmWuCgJmxo\r\n\r\nDirector: Andy Serkis\r\n\r\nCast: Tom Hardy, Woody Harrelson, Michelle Williams, Naomie Harris, Reid Scott\r\n\r\nRelease date: 1 October 2021\r\n\r\nIMDb rating: 5.9\/10\r\n\r\nSynopsis: Eddie Brock (Hardy) and Venom confront a formidable new adversary, serial killer Cletus Kasady (Harrelson), who becomes the host for the Carnage symbiote. While Brock continues to struggle for dominance over his own body with Venom, he begins to recognise the full extent of his alien abilities. In order to defeat the deranged Kasady, Brock and Venom must set aside their differences and unite to protect the world. Brock also seizes the opportunity to vex the new fianc\u00e9, Dr. Dan Lewis, (Scott) of his ex-girlfriend, Anne Weying (Williams), using his parasitic alter-ego to gain an advantage in their rivalry.\r\n\r\nAbout the movie: Venom: Let There Be Carnage was one of the first significant releases following the pandemic. As such, it achieved several financial milestones, including one of the largest openings in October's history. The film amassed a total of USD 506.9 million globally, securing its position as the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2021.\r\n\r\nWatch Venom: Let There Be Carnage on Netflix\r\n3.

At the same time, additional members of the symbiote species arrive on Earth to summon their siblings. As they evade capture, the duo confronts a heart-wrenching choice that will ultimately conclude Venom and Eddie's final journey together.\r\n\r\nAbout the movie: Kelly Marcel, who has previously written and produced the earlier Venom films, makes her directorial debut with this third instalment. Venom: The Last Dance also introduces the symbiote god Knull.\r\nSo how do Spider-Man 3 and Spider-Man: No Way Home fit into the Venomverse?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1934944\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"806\"] Image: Courtesy IMDb\/Spider-Man 3[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSpider-Man 3 (2007) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) do not technically count as movies in the Venom franchise movies, but they do make the symbiotic experience complete.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWatching the 2007 Tobey Maguire-led movie before starting Hardy\u2019s Venom (2018) will give you an idea of how the original Spider-Man series treated the villainous symbiote.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the 2021 Tom Holland film, Venom makes a playful appearance during the mid-credits sequence. Recall the scene in Let There Be Carnage where Brock was transported into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. We find him in a rundown bar, engaging in conversation with the bartender about \"super individuals\" and expressing scepticism regarding the existence of Thanos. Just as Eddie resolves to travel to New York City, he is abruptly returned to his original universe, teasing behind the possibility of a Spidey-Venom face-off in the MCU.\r\n\r\n(Hero and featured image courtesy: IMDb\/Venom: The Last Dance\/Venom: Let There Be Carnage)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"'The Apprentice': What's true and what isn't in the Donald Trump biopic","position":34,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/movies\/true-story-of-the-apprentice-movie-donald-trump-sebastian-stan-jeremy-strong\/","description":"What exactly is fact and fiction in the new biopic about the once-more President-Elect? Here's what you need to know about the true story behind\u00a0The Apprentice.\r\n\r\nThe Apprentice (2024) movie is a biographical drama tracing the early years of Donald Trump as he transforms from a young businessperson to an omnipresent public figure. The events of this film highlight the formative years of the 1970s and 1980s in Trump's real estate business and his association with notorious lawyer Roy Cohn which shaped his tactics towards power, publicity, and litigation. It is, at the same time, a character study and a chronicle of Trump's early business decisions, which formed the groundwork for the man who would later become one of the most polarising figures in modern history. Here is everything you need to know about the real story behind The Apprentice (2024) as well as its cast, release date, official trailer and more.\r\n\r\nHelmed by Ali Abbasi, who wrote it with Maren Louise K\u00e4ehne, the film stars Sebastian Stan as Trump and Jeremy Strong (Kendall Roy of HBO\u2019s Succession) as Cohn in lead roles.\r\nThe Apprentice (2024): The real story behind the movie\r\nDonald Trump's early ambitions\r\nAt the start of the 1970s, young Donald Trump, son of real estate tycoon Fred Trump was eager to take his family's business beyond New York City's outer boroughs. While Fred (played by Martin Donovan who you might know from Christopher Nolan films like Memento and Tenet) made his money developing affordable housing projects, Donald wanted to get into Manhattan's high-end real estate market in order to earn himself a reputation as a powerful business leader.\r\n\r\nThis interest in wealth and glory pushed Donald Trump's ambitions further. However, his business practices even then were not free from controversies. In 1973, the US Department of Justice indicted Trump Management, his family's real estate company, for discriminatory practices against African-American tenants. A federal investigation claimed that Trump Management kept black families away from renting apartments while giving preference to white tenants, a case that could have destroyed the family name of the Trumps.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1934938\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Sebastian Stan as Donald Trump and Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn. (Image: Courtesy of \u00a9 Apprentice Productions Ontario Inc. \/ Profile Productions 2 APS \/ Tailored Films Ltd. 2023\/ IMDb)[\/caption]\r\nRoy Cohn: The mentor with ruthless tactics\r\nIt was during this time that a champion emerged for Trump in the form of Roy Cohn, an attorney infamous for the ruthlessness of his methods. Cohn was a man who had been both partially responsible for the infamous espionage case of the Rosenbergs in 1953, for which they were executed, and closely associated with Senator Joseph McCarthy during the purges of anti-Communism in the 1950s (for more, read McCarthyism).\r\n\r\nThis relationship between Trump and Cohn is the central theme of the movie. On-screen, the first scene of their meeting takes place in an exclusive Manhattan restaurant where a frustrated Trump speaks of his frustration with the federal investigation into his family business, which is an accusation by the government. Cohn, sensing the ambition and readiness of Trump to play by the rules and then break them, offers himself as Trump's legal counsellor and coach.\r\n\r\nCohn schooled Trump in approaching challenges with a combative mindset: his three principles were always attack, never retreat, and always stand your ground, even if you have lost. This philosophy became the basis of Trump's public persona. With Cohn, Trump's real estate operations became bolder and bolder. He launched high-profile projects: renovated what was then the Commodore Hotel and is now the Grand Hyatt, and built Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue.\r\nThe impact of their relationship\r\nThe partnership of Trump and Cohn was not only professional but a personal alliance based on mutual benefit. Cohn provided Trump with legal protection and political connections to help him secure deals and manage legal issues. In return, Trump opened to him a network of rich influential figures.\r\n\r\nBut Cohn's private life was strewn with scandals, and among them were his disbarment and public outing as a closeted homosexual in the midst of the AIDS epidemic. Even so, Trump publicly broke with him only when the lawyer's influence began to wane \u1173 a step that reminded one of Trump's later modus operandi of casting off those no longer serving his purposes.\r\nThe real events depicted in the film\r\nThe Apprentice opens with the real-life federal lawsuit against Trump Management, a pivotal moment in Donald Trump\u2019s early career. The case was eventually settled without an admission of wrongdoing, but the film depicts how Trump leveraged his connections with Cohn to manage the fallout and maintain his public image.\r\n\r\nAnother significant aspect of the movie is Trump\u2019s ability to use media attention to his advantage. As seen in the film, Trump courted journalists and cultivated an image as a brash, successful entrepreneur, even when his projects were financially risky or legally contentious. This manipulation of media perception became one of Trump\u2019s key tools throughout his career.\r\n\r\nThe film also explores Trump\u2019s personal life, including his marriage to Ivana Trump (played by Maria Bakalova, who rose to fame with 2021\u2019s comedy movie Borat Subsequent Moviefilm). It shows how Trump\u2019s relationships were often transactional, driven by status and appearances. His marriage to Ivana, a Czech model and businesswoman, was an important part of building his public image in the 1980s. There is an extremely disturbing rape scene in the movie.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1934940\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"] Maria Bakalova as Ivana, who was Trump's first wife. (Image: Courtesy of \u00a9 Apprentice Productions Ontario Inc. \/ Profile Productions 2 APS \/ Tailored Films Ltd. 2023\/ IMDb)[\/caption]\r\nThemes of power, influence, and control\r\nAt its heart, The Apprentice is not just a Donald Trump biopic and not even a dramatisation of his relationship with Cohn \u2014 it is a commentary on the dynamics of power, influence, and ambition in America. Trump and Cohn embody the idea that success in US politics and business often comes at the cost of integrity and conscience. The film depicts Trump as a product of the 1980s \u2014 this was the time in America when greed, ambition, and personal branding were in and fairness and transparency were out \u2014 so to speak.\r\n\r\nThe movie is also a reflection on how powerful figures like Trump can mobilise their connections, media narratives and legal measures to craft personas that common people can identify with in some sort of way. For instance, while Trump has wealth that would dwarfs most Americans\u2019 imagination, his brash attitude, anti-establishment rhetoric and claims of being a self-made success story resonates with many common people in the country.\r\n\r\nTrump's rise to fame during this period set him up for his future political career, where strategies of media manipulation, attack tactics, and incessant self-promotion would be even more apparent.\r\nThe Apprentice (2024) movie official trailer\r\nWatch The Apprentice (2024) movie's official trailer here:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apprentice movie: Where to watch?\r\nThe Apprentice movie will release in theatres.\r\nThe Apprentice movie release date\r\nThe Apprentice movie release date in India is 18 October, while in the US and many other markets, it released on 11 October.\r\nThe Apprentice movie full cast\r\nBesides Sebastian Stan, Jeremy Strong and Martin Donovan, The Apprentice movie features Mark Rendall and Joe Pingue in the cast."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"\u2018The Lord of the Rings\u2019 trilogy returns to theatres in Thailand this November","position":35,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/movies\/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-theatres-thailand-november\/","description":"Return to Middle-Earth on the big screen when The Lord of the Rings comes back to theatres this November here in Thailand.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s been 23 years since the first of the Lord of the Rings movies came out.

Is Moo Deng now a zionist? Has she been infected by the woke? Experts weigh in on the topic.\r\nMoo Deng weighs in on US presidential election with Trump on her mind\r\nNow at five months of age, Moo Deng the pygmy hippo is entering a point in her career where it's difficult to shy away from the public eye. With her claim to fame being running around biting zookeepers and getting splashed with water, it is still up in the air whether Moo Deng is a one-hit wonder or a true nepo baby. After all, with her own livestream and merch line, she's only one scandal away from being one of the Kardashians.\r\n\r\nRecently, Moo Deng weighed in on the presidential election now underway in the United States. Presented with two cakes, one labelled \"Kamala Harris\" and another labelled \"Donald Trump\" (Jill Stein nowhere to be seen), Moo Deng made the choice to eat the Donald Trump cake.\r\n\r\nEven though she clearly ate the Trump cake, her intent is still up in the air. Sources say Moo Deng failed to comment on what her action really entails, only making pygmy hippo noises to those who tried to inquire.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/DB-WF05yE1g\/?igsh=MXNuN2syZGp4dGdpbw%3D%3D\r\nIs Moo Deng endorsing Donald Trump? What does it all mean?\r\nOn the one hand, many think this is Moo Deng stating her intent to endorse Donald Trump as the next president of the United States. A prediction is not a prediction if with knowledge of what's happening, and with her celebrity status and alleged connections to the western world, Moo Deng may know a thing or two of what's to come in the Land of the Free.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other netizens believe her seemingly-erroneous act is in fact, the opposite of an endorsement. By eating the Trump cake, it is a symbolic move on Moo Deng's part to destroy the representation of the orange man, thereby preserving Kamala Harris from being harmed by his jaws. Furthermore, at the time of writing, Trump has a whopping net worth of USD 5.6 billion. Moo Deng eating his cake may be representative of her eating the rich -- a nod to the voters who identify within the economic left.\r\n\r\nAs the US elections are coming to a close soon, fans are keeping a close eye on whether Moo Deng's prediction is correct, or if she is entering her flop era just by participating in the prediction."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Game on, wayward son: Gaming hangouts in Bangkok","position":39,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/entertainment\/gaming-hangouts-in-bangkok-bamboo-esc-arcadia-topgolf\/","description":"If you\u2019re a gamer then you should definitely check out these gaming hangouts here in Bangkok.\r\n\r\nWe gamers are comfortable staying within the confines of our homes.

Read on to find out more about Babygirl starring Nicole Kidman.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the perfect way to spend your Christmas day this year? You can have a family brunch, open your presents, or you can head to the movie theater and watch Nicole Kidman get all steamy in the erotic thriller Babygirl. Entertainment company A24 is giving audiences a titillating gift this holiday season by releasing the film on Christmas day. Despite this, it\u2019s not advisable to bring the whole family along for a special Christmas movie experience because it is salacious. How salacious exactly? The 57-year-old actress at one point in filming said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to orgasm any more.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\nRead on to find out more about A24\u2019s new erotic thriller Babygirl starring Nicole Kidman, what the story is about, and what made the actress make such a statement.\r\n\r\n[Hero image: A24]\r\nEverything you need to know about Babygirl, the new A24 movie starring Nicole Kidman\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-8Sx6U6Ou0Q\r\nWhat is Babygirl about?\r\nThe film revolves around Romy, played by Kidman, who has a picture-perfect life: a loving husband, adoring kids, a comfortable lifestyle, and the enviable position of being a high-ranking CEO. She meets Samuel, a young man who is one of the new interns in the company, and is almost immediately drawn to him. The two soon start a forbidden affair that plays around with their power dynamic, giving Romy an experience she\u2019s never had before.\r\n\r\n \r\nWho\u2019s in the movie?\r\nNicole Kidman plays Romy, the CEO, wife, and mother who gets into a steamy affair with Samuel, played by The King\u2019s Man\u2019s Harris Dickinson. Antonio Banderas is also in the movie playing Romy\u2019s husband, Jacob.\u00a0\r\n\r\n \r\nWhen is the movie being released?\r\nThe movie is slated for a theatrical release in the US on December 25 but there\u2019s no word yet on whether it will have a global release here in Thailand. However, the film already premiered in August at the Venice Film Festival and later at the Toronto Film Festival so critics have seen it.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1934287\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image credit: A24[\/caption]\r\nAnd what are the critics saying?\r\nTo put it succinctly, they\u2019re raving. The Hollywood Reporter called it \u201csexy, dark and unpredictable\u201d while Deadline said that Kidman \u201creally goes the distance\u201d. The Times likened it to \u201cthe best BDSM experiences\u201d saying that the movie \u201cis slightly contrived but very satisfying\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe film holds a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 5.9 on IMDB.\r\n\r\n \r\nAnd why in the world did Nicole Kidman say she didn\u2019t want any more orgasms?\r\nAccording to an interview she did with The Sun, there were times when filming the racier scenes of the movie got a little too much. \u201cThere was an enormous amount of sharing and trust and then frustratio,\u201d Kidman explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Don\u2019t touch me\u2019. There were times when we were shooting where I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to orgasm any more.Don\u2019t come near me. I hate doing this.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nShe continued, \u201cI\u2019m over it. It was so present all the time for me that it was almost like a burnout.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer co-star, Harris Dickinson, shared her sentiments. The same article reported that in a press conference, Dickinson said that there were times he would tell the crew and his co-stars to \u201cgo away for a second\u201d if he and Kidman \u201cweren\u2019t comfortable\u201d.\r\n\r\n \r\nIs this the first erotic film Nicole Kidman has been in?\r\nNope. Kidman starred in Eyes Wide Shut back in 1999 with her then-husband Tom Cruise. However, she said that she couldn\u2019t have done the more daring scenes in this movie if a man was at the helm of the film. Unlike Eyes Wide Shut, which was directed by Stanley Kubrick, Babygirl is directed by Halina Reijn.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I could have done it, working with a man,\u201d she explained in The Sun interview. \u201cI actually think the only way I could do this was with her because the two of us would sit and talk.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1934286\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"806\"] Image credit: A24[\/caption]\r\nIs Babygirl a Christmas movie?\r\nDefinitely. It comes out on December 25th. This may be the very first erotic Christmas movie in movie history. Congrats, A24.\r\n\r\n \r\nIs it a family Christmas movie?\r\nWe\u2019ll say it again loud and clear: if you value your relationship with your parents and your other family members, for the love of Atlanna, do not watch this with them. Unless you want to, in which case, get help.\u00a0\r\n\r\n "}]}</script>
