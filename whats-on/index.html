Check out our guide for the best Rolling Loud Thailand 2024 experience.\r\n\r\nRolling Loud Thailand 2024 is just around the corner, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited. With headliners like Wiz Khalifa, Tyla, Playboy Carti, and Ski Mask the Slump God, we\u2019re sure that the vibes this year will be even more insane, especially with A$AP Rocky performing on the first night.\r\n\r\nWherever you\u2019re coming from, here\u2019s everything you need to know to enhance your festival experience, including transportation, accommodation, outfit suggestions and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nA guide to Rolling Loud Thailand 2024: Transportation, accommodation, expectations, and more\r\n\r\nGetting to and from Rolling Loud Thailand 2024\r\nBook rides via transport apps\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935771\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1440\"] Image Credit: Grab[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe easiest and most convenient option is to take either a Grab or Bolt from your hotel in Pattaya to Legend Siam. It usually costs around THB 100-500 to get there, depending on how far you are away from the destination. However, coming back is a bit of a hassle, and might take some time, so consider these other options.\r\nHire a private van service\r\nWhen leaving the festival, it can be difficult to get a Grab ride home. Therefore, we highly recommend to hire a private van service. While this option can be pricey, it becomes quite worthwhile if you come with a group of friends, as it can save you a lot of time and money. Prices typically start around THB 2,000, depending on the company you select, and the driver can wait for you until you are ready to leave. For those who prefer to arrive in style, Infinity Luxe Chauffeur provides a more luxurious experience.\r\nYak shuttle bus service\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935780\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Image Credit: Yak[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFor those looking for a shuttle bus, Yak is offering this service, but make sure to pre book your seats here.\r\nDrive there yourself \r\nOnly do this if you have a designated driver who isn\u2019t intoxicated because there will be police checkpoints.\r\nWhere to stay (less than 10 minutes away from Rolling Loud)\r\nRenaissance Pattaya Resort & Spa\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1935772\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2048\"] Image Credit: Renaissance Pattaya Resort & Spa[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOnly 8 minutes away from the festival, Renaissance Pattaya Resort & Spa is an amazing beachfront hotel.

However, when it comes to bags, Rolling Loud has a strict policy. No backpacks, purses, or bags are allowed to be brought into the venue. Festival-goers can only bring bags that are clear plastic, vinyl, or PVC, and do not exceed 12\" x 6\" x 12\u201d. You can purchase Rolling Loud plastic bags before the main entrance. Although they say small clutch bags can enter, it\u2019s best not to risk it. Read more on the Rolling Loud bag policy page..\r\n\r\n\r\nWear light weight and breathable clothing\r\nYou'll most likely be on your feet all day and night, so dress smart for the occasion. Even though it's November in Thailand and the weather is a bit cooler, it gets quite warm and sweaty in the crowds. Bathing suits, tiny tops, streetwear, and athleisure are great options. Just make sure that you feel good physically and mentally in what you wear.\r\nBring a portable charger \u00a0\r\nAs the gates usually open at 3 PM and the event lasts just a little past midnight, it\u2019s best to keep your phone charged so you can stay in contact with your friends.\r\nDownload the Rolling Loud app\r\nRolling Loud has multiple stages with simultaneous performances, so plan out who you want to see by downloading the app for set times and navigation.\r\n\r\nFind more info on Rolling Loud Thailand 2024 here."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Weekly Obessions: Peace by Silsupa, Patou x Onitsuka Tiger, and more","position":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/whats-on\/weekly-obessions-peace-by-silsupa-patou-x-onitsuka-tiger-and-more\/","description":"Welcome back to\u00a0LSA\u2019s Weekly Obsessions, where we share a few things we\u2019re currently mad about \u2014 because if it\u2019s on our radar, it should definitely be on yours, too.

Now, if I\u2019m being totally honest, I\u2019ve been avoiding this brand for a while because how good could their products be? After trying their Blurring Matte Finish Lip Liner in Mauve, I am sold. The size of it, the way it is shaped, consistency, pigment, basically everything about this is incredible. The product has a velvety texture that when applied glides like silk. I\u2019ve also never had a lip product that exactly matched my natural lip colour, yet also enhanced it.

The Maison commissioned Laurentine Perilhou, a renowned French artist, where she uses real gold thread, sourced from Lyon, meticulously weaving them into a complex vine motif. Another remarkable feature is the crown, embellished with three synthetic sapphires and set on a 22-karat gold base. As for the cognac itself, the liquid is a remarkable blend of two outstanding eau-de-vies sourced from the Grande Champagne cru, each aged for over 70 years. Its smooth flavourful profile is truly exceptional with notes of cedar, honey, and candied fruit. \u2013T.C., Content Writer\r\nBlue de Chanel Fragranced Hair Care\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1934261\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1500\"] Image Credit: CHANEL[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to achieving a long-lasting fragrance, simply applying perfume to your body may not be enough.

While Diddy is at the centre of media attention for several serious allegations levelled against him, the emergence of his son\u2019s video has given a boost to conspiracy theorists and renewed interest in the Illuminati.\r\n\r\n'Illuminati\u2019 is the plural form of the Latin word illuminatus meaning enlightened. It was also the name of a movement inspired by Freemasons and French Enlightenment philosophers centuries ago. It has now taken a completely different form after the purported demise of the major secret societies that carried the thought. Today, conspiracy theorists refer to the Illuminati as a secret group comprising anyone from politicians and billionaire businessmen to celebrities who control the world. This is also why they, and other similar alleged secret societies, are referred to as the 'New World Order.'\r\nInteresting facts about the Illuminati explained\r\nWas there a real Illuminati?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1934034\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1500\"] A demonstration against the 'New World Order' in Prague in 2010. (Image: Courtesy of By Kychot - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nYes, many secret societies were referred to as the Illuminati at different points in history.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest was the 15th-century Alumbrados, whose name itself means \u2018enlightened\u2019 in Spanish. According to Spanish scholar Marcelino Men\u00e9ndez y Pelayo, the group had a Gnostic origin. One of the earliest leaders was Mar\u00eda de Santo Domingo, who claimed that she could converse directly with Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. Mar\u00eda was tried under the auspices of the Inquisition and so were many others associated with Alumbrados. By 1623, the movement entered France under the name Illumin\u00e9s and quickly spread throughout the country before their eventual suppression or disappearance.\r\n\r\nRosicrucians was another 15th or 16th-century secret society believed to share similar ideological thoughts but was perhaps much more influential than those preceding it. Founded by Christian Rosenkreuz, it managed to keep a lot of its affairs secret for over 100 years, including its very existence. Fama Fraternitatis, a manifesto first published in 1614, gives details of Rosenkreuz and the society. According to Britannica, many prominent members of the then society were believed to be associated with the Rosicrucians order. These included British physician Robert Fludd, British statesman Sir Francis Bacon and German alchemist Michael Maier.\r\n\r\nBut the group with which the modern-day name Illuminati is most closely associated is an 18th-century anti-religious movement in Bavaria, Germany. Even though it was short-lived, this group, widely known as the Bavarian Illuminati, is the one that is historically seen as the true originator of the term \u2018Illuminati.\u2019\r\nWho created the Bavarian Illuminati?\r\nThe Bavarian Illuminati was founded in 1776 by a former Jesuit named Adam Weishaupt. His goal was to replace Christianity with his republican free thought and reason. Its members and followers called themselves 'Perfectibilists.'\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting facts about the Bavarian Illuminati is that they were very well-structured and divided into three classes in a hierarchical order. Weishaupt began the spread of the order from Ingolstadt, where he was a professor of canon law. It quickly covered several cities of Bavaria and inducted influential members of the society in its ranks. Within two years, their members began taking up important positions in Masonic lodges. By this time, its structure became even more complex with correspondence conducted in cipher and members addressed in code names.\r\n\r\nHistorical records suggest that the Bavarian Illuminati stretched from Italy to Denmark and Paris to Warsaw at its peak. Yet it is believed that its members were never more than 2,000.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most well-known facts that German Freemason and writer Adolph Freiherr Knigge was associated with the Bavarian Illuminati. Though not confirmed, it is believed that other members included icons of German intelligentsia such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Johann Gottfried von Herder, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, Friedrich Leopold and Graf zu Stolberg-Stolberg as well as nobles such as Charles Augustus of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Ernest II of Gotha, the latter of whom was Queen Victoria's brother-in-law and therefore connected to the British royal family as well.\r\nWhat happened to the Bavarian Illuminati?\r\nIn 1785, Karl Theodor, Duke of Bavaria, banned all secret societies including the Illuminati, which had already been somewhat weakened by internal strife.\r\n\r\nWeishaupt was removed from his position in Ingolstadt and was subsequently sent into exile. Some other members were imprisoned or forced out of their homes.\r\n\r\nBut Weishaupt, who moved to Gotha, didn\u2019t entirely cease his work on the Illuminati. Before his death in 1830, he wrote a series of books on illuminism such as An Apology for the Illuminati (1786) and An Improved System of Illuminism (1787).\r\n\r\nThe term \u2018illuminati\u2019, however, remained in use. Martinez Pasqualis founded the French Martinists in 1754, which came to be known as a successor to 'illuminati' and spread the order to Russia by the late 18th century.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did the Illuminati conspiracy theories emerge?\r\nConspiracy theories about the Illuminati started soon after the end of the Bavarian Illuminati. British physicist John Robison and French journalist Abbe Augustin Barruel were among the prominent people who spread Illuminati conspiracy theories, including an allegation that they were behind the French Revolution (1789\u20131799). Even the Founding Fathers of America, including George Washington, mentioned the Illuminati.\r\n\r\nBut the modern Illuminati conspiracy theories trace their roots to the 1960s. According to the BBC, one of the key facts is that this alleged secret society of the present has hardly any connection to the Bavarian Illuminati and was originally meant to be nothing more than a parody.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn era of counter-culture mania, LSD and interest in Eastern philosophy is largely responsible for the group\u2019s (totally unsubstantiated) modern incarnation,\u201d says BBC.\r\n\r\nIts origin can be traced to a text known as Principia Discordia, which created a fake religion and fake deity purely for fun during the time of the counter-culture movement.\r\nHow did the new Illuminati conspiracy theories spread?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1934036\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"662\"] The cover of The Illuminatus! Trilogy which made the Illuminati widely known in modern times. (Image: Courtesy of Amazon)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAmerican author Robert Anton Wilson is credited alongside Kerry Thornley, one of the authors of Principia Discordia, for spreading the conspiracy theory of Illuminati as a means to foster confusion in what they believed was an increasingly authoritarian world.\r\n\r\nIt was their elaborate strategy of spreading disinformation that gave birth to the modern-day Illuminati, according to the BBC. The concept of the \u2018illuminati\u2019 was further popularised when Wilson co-authored The Illuminatus! Trilogy with American journalist Robert Shea. The sci-fi fantasy novels gave birth to a series of conspiracy theories which, among others, included a theory of a \u2018cover-up\u2019 of the 1963 assassination of US President John F. Kennedy by the Illuminati.\r\n\r\nThe success of the books, their adaptations for the stage and various pop culture references contributed to the conspiracy theories gaining ground among the masses by the 1970s. The advent of the Internet age massively boosted the fascination with the Illuminati secret society.\r\nAre there any differences between the modern Illuminati and others?\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1934038\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1225\"] The reverse of a US One Dollar bill. Notice the Eye of Providence symbol in the seal on the left. (Image: Courtesy of Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons)[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThough their ways were highly secretive, the Bavarian Illuminati was seen as anti-monarchist and anti-religious. They believed in rational thought and free expression of the masses, which made them more akin to the revolutionaries of that age.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a modern Illuminati, quite ironically, is nothing but a conspiracy theory in itself, one which is more widely accepted among right-wingers who believe that everything from governments to civil society is controlled by a handful of powerful elites.\r\n\r\nThe Illuminati is also different from Freemasonry, though the latter have also been subjected to baseless conspiracy theories largely due to their complex structure, enigmatic use of symbols and a series of powerful members in their long history. Many believe that the floating eye on the US dollar comes from the Freemasonry symbol of the Eye of Providence (also known as the All-Seeing Eye). The sign is also used by Illuminati conspiracy theorists today to refer to the secret society. This is why one of the interesting facts about Illuminati is that they are often confused with Freemasons.\r\nWhich celebrities are believed to be part of the Illuminati?\r\nMusic icons such as Madonna, Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9 and Kanye West have been accused of being part of the Illuminati cult. Some were allegedly seen making hand signs of the All-Seeing Eye or wearing the symbol on different occasions. But these are baseless accusations concocted by their critics and conspiracy theorists.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any truth to the claims of Illuminati conspiracy theorists?\r\nNo, everything about the new-age Illuminati and the alleged incidents they are believed to have been involved in are false. These are, as is rightly labelled, \u2018conspiracy theories\u2019 that are generally bandied about by right-wingers or those who lack education against prominent people they dislike, such as progressive leaders like US President Joe Biden and former president Barack Obama.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the most important of all facts about the Illuminati is that their myths have no basis and must not be believed by rational minds. Moreover, there has never been any evidence to remotely suggest that anything the Illuminati conspiracy theorists claim has even a grain of truth.\r\n\r\n(Hero and Featured images: Courtesy of Renato Rocca\/@renato-rocca-2397962 via Pexels)"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Festival-goers, gather your fannypacks: A guide to every music festival in Thailand this 2024","position":20,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/whats-on\/events-whats-on\/guide-to-music-festivals-in-thailand-this-2024-wonderfruit-rolling-loud-tickets-details\/","description":"Prep your body for the porta-potty because festival season is back.

Whilst Thailand sees a number of music festivals throughout the year, most are concentrated towards the end of the year. The weather is cooler, the festive bonus is out, and everything feels a little lighter in the months of November and December.\r\nWhether you prefer the string of the guitar at an indie gathering, a trek through the forest in the northern mountains, or an electrifying night on the dance floor in Bangkok, there is plenty to party if you play your cards right. For a full guide, read on for our Thailand music festival calendar with key dates to mark now.\r\n[Hero Image Credit: Wonderfruit; Featured Image Credit: Maho Rasop]\r\nA guide to music festivals in Thailand this 2024, from Bae Vibes to Wonderfruit\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1933684\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Image Credit: Monster Music Festival[\/caption]\r\nMonster Music Festival 2024\r\nDates: 2-3 November 2024\r\nLocation: Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre, Bangkok\r\nTickets: From THB 1500\r\nHeadliners: Lykn, Nont Tanont, Blackbeans, Porsche, Diamond Narakorn, and so many more\r\nOne for the youngsters, if you\u2019re into Thai artists, Monster Music Festival is a must-visit. The music festival spans 2 full days and takes place across five stages, with artists from Nont Tanont and Milli to Jeff Satur. There\u2019s something for everybody, and it\u2019s taking place right in the heart of town, too. Compared to some of the other music festivals on our list, this is one of the more price-friendly options.\r\n Image Credit: Bae Vibes[\/caption]\r\nBae Vibes\r\nDates: 9 November 2024\r\nLocation: Studio Lam, Bangkok\r\nTickets: From THB 450 (THB 700 at the door)\r\nHeadliners: Skaai, Rejizz, Subnet, G-bear\r\nTaking place on one day only, Bae Vibes is a smaller music festival which takes place at the epicentre of music-cool, Studio Lam.

Returning to Asia for its 2024 edition, the world\u2019s largest hip-hop festival will take place in Pattaya again, and promises yet another electrifying weekend. The lineup is pretty impressive, and features ASAP Rocky, Tyga, Tyla, Akon, Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa, French Montana, Bambam, Rich The Kid, to name just a handful. Three-day passes are highly recommended, and maybe take an extra day off work to recover from the hangover, too.\r\n Image Credit: Maho Rasop[\/caption]\r\nMaho Rasop Festival 2024\r\nDates: 23-24 November 2024\r\nLocation: Esc Park, Bangkok\r\nTickets: From THB 3490 for a one-day pass, or THB 4990 for a two-day pass (from THB 4990 for one-day VIP)\r\nHeadliners: Addy x Hippo Campus, Air\r\nMaho Rasop is an annual independent music festival that takes place in Bangkok, and has really gained respect from an international community of music lovers. Spotlighting music diversity, the lineup is always highly anticipated, featuring specially curated artists that are known for quality live performances. Quite literally giving a stage to lesser-known artists, you can expect an array of genres, from punk and jazz to underground and hip-hop acts.\r\n Image Credit: Double Dick Tiger[\/caption]\r\nDouble Dick Tiger 2024\r\nDates: 28 November-1 December 2024\r\nLocation: Chiang Dao\r\nTickets: From THB 8000 (early bird)\r\nHeadliners: Not confirmed yet\r\nHere\u2019s one for the more adventurous souls. Double Dick Tiger is one of the lesser-known Thai music festivals, though it has amassed quite a loyal following. For those looking \u201cto seek and share nature\u2019s highest pleasures,\u201d this 4-day event is all about camping out in the forest for a few days and enjoying a simpler life. While you will need to bring most of the essentials (including your own tent), meals, water, local coffee, and even local alcohol are included in the ticket price. If you\u2019re lucky, you may even meet the eponymous double dick tiger.\r\nLineup details have not been unveiled yet, though previous artists include Bonita Everett, Mumsfilibaba, Jakrin V. Bueren, and Sarayu.\r\n Image Credit: 808 Festival[\/caption]\r\n808 Festival 2024\r\nDates: 6-8 December 2024\r\nLocation: Bitec Bang Na, Bangkok\r\nTickets: Only Tier 2 available now, priced at THB 4200 for three-day pass\r\nHeadliners: Anyma presents Genesys, Adam Beyer, Chase & Status, James HYPE, Mau P, Miss Monique, Sara Landry\r\nThe eleventh edition of 808 Festival comes to Bangkok this 6-8 December. The electronic music festival was founded in 2013, bringing together EDM fans from across the region.

Whilst Wonderfruit is primarily a music festival (find us at Molam World especially), there is so much to explore at this 24-hour festival, from dining experiences to workshops, talks, and wellness journeys.

Of course, we had to jump in on this trend, and it was honestly not as hard as it sounds. All you have to do is apply a deep pink blush and highlight your cheekbones to make your face pop. However, the real secret to achieving this look is the lips. Sabrina loves using lip liners to add dimension and fullness. Therefore, we decided to use the Artist Color Pencil from Make Up For Ever because the product is smooth, easy to apply, highly pigmented, and long-lasting. Another tip is to apply it a little bit inward after lining the lips to add more dimension. Don't forget to top it off with a coat of lip gloss. \u2013 P.T., Senior Writer\r\n\r\n"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Where to watch the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2024: Angels, Lisa BLACKPINK, and more","position":24,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/whats-on\/events-whats-on\/victoria-secret-fashion-show-2024-where-to-watch-lisa-blackpink-models-live-stream\/","description":"The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show returns to the runway this 15 October 2024.

The second event of the series was held on October 2, 2024 at F45 Bangkok, in partnership with OLY, Opium Bar, and Restaurant Potong. \n\n\n\nThe evening saw an influx of participants arriving well before 6pm, eagerly anticipating getting to form new connections through the beauty of an intense workout. As the actual workout was not bound to begin until 7pm, participants had the opportunity to enjoy delicious snacks and amuse-bouche while simultaneously getting to know each other on a deeper level, whether it was through their mutual love or disdain of burning calories. \n\n\n\nThe Pipeline workout by F45 commenced at 7pm sharp - designed to push participants out of their comfort zone and train like a true surfer, the workout was exactly as advertised. The LSA Club members were put through a quick warm-up, and their very last opportunity to catch their breath, as the next 45 minutes were followed by 4 laps of box jumps, sled pushes, ski ergs, reverse burpees, battling ropes, kettlebell push presses, oblique crunches and reverse lunges - with only a 15 second break in between. Sweaty high-fives and hugs all around!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the group cooled down post-workout, they enjoyed delicious food courtesy of our partners at Opium Bar and Restaurant Potong, and protein-filled guilt-free treats, courtesy of OLY, before diving into a game of human bingo, where their competitive spirits were once again revitalised. Members were on high-alert, trying to match each cue on their bingo card to someone they had just met, and at the very end, four lucky people walked away with prizes from OLY. \n\n\n\nWith the HIIT portion of the evening officially over, the rest of the night was open to participants SIP-ping as they continued to mingle and form new friendships. \n\n\n\nThe LSA Club continues to position itself as the hub for expats and Thai internationals to forge new connections and form relationships that will continue to help them create opportunities and navigate the complexities of life and business in Thailand. \n\n\n\nThe HIIT & SIP event by The LSA Club was curated with the support of\u00a079 Art Studio Company Limited.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe next event by The LSA Club will be held on Wednesday, October 30th\u00a0at Opium Bar Bangkok.

However, I've found a product that can help reverse these effects. I recently had an amazing facial and tried out some nourishing skincare products from Shiseido. After 40 years of genetic research, Shiseido has launched its New Future Solution LX line. This line contains the legendary Enmei herb and utilises CCN2 technology to strengthen the dermis's structure, texture, and quality. While many products claim to transform the skin, I truly felt a difference after the treatment. My skin was bright, hydrated, clear, and super bouncy. Anyway, let\u2019s see what happens after a few months, as they said you\u2019ll notice the effectiveness even more. \u2013Tipapa Chandarasrivongs, Content Writer\r\nChanel SS25\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1932280\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1708\"] Image Credit: Chanel[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSince Chanel is still without a creative director, the brand\u2019s Studio Design team has decided to come together to release a new collection combining all their iconic and best-selling pieces. Their new SS2025 line was unveiled at the Grand Palais along with an introduction of their brand ambassador Riley Keough who swung and sang on the runway. Models like Ella McCutcheon and Nigina Sharipova made an appearance as well. As for the collection itself, we saw Chanel\u2019s signature black and white hues, tweed fabric, jackets, bows, and brooches in their usual style. \u2013 Pannatorn Tamnipanon, Senior Writer\r\nSephora Collection Fluff & Fix Brow Wax\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1932247\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Image Credit: Sephora[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAnother item that I'm currently obsessed with is Sephora\u2019s brow wax. As someone who loves a good brow, I\u2019ve recently discovered an amazing and affordable brow gel on TikTok. Sephora\u2019s Fluff & Fix Brow Wax is one of the best products I\u2019ve ever laid my hands on. It\u2019s honestly so surprising how incredible this product is. Your brows stay in shape all day. It\u2019s not sticky, and it doesn\u2019t leave that white residue, unlike other products. Plus, it\u2019s only THB 650. What a steal, and a must-have. \u00a0\u2013T.C., Content Writer\r\nFope New Collection\r\n[gallery columns=\"2\" size=\"full\" ids=\"1932283,1932284\"]\r\n\r\nThe Flex\u2019it technique is a unique invention by the famous Italian brand FOPE that uses a system of tiny 18-carat gold springs inserted between the links of the gold weave. This patented method makes wearing the jewellery comfortable due to its smoothness. This year, the brand unveils a new collection called Luna Full Moon, which not only maintains the original technique but also introduces a new technique called By Color, featuring a two-tone design. One item that we love is the choker necklace that comes with a square lock and Pav\u00e9 diamonds. Another collection, Bubble, is inspired by the beauty of soap bubbles when in the air and the light hits, creating various hues. \u2013 P.T., Senior Writer\r\nAmi pop-up\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1932246\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1830\"] Image Credit: Ami[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAs someone who enjoys Ami apparel, especially the iconic 'A' with the heart motif, I\u2019m super excited to hear that Le Caf\u00e9 Ami Bangkok will be open soon at M LUXE Hall in Siam Paragon.

Here's everything you need for that gay wedding of your dreams.\r\n\r\nWhen that question comes up, and you said yes, and the ring pops onto your finger, it's only just the beginning. All those smiles turn into a stressed frown as you realise how much goes into planning a wedding, and how much it costs to have that gay wedding of your dreams. That quaint garden wedding seems far-fetched now that your parents got involved, and how do we sit these guests together again?\r\n\r\nNow that marriage equality is official becoming legal, let's pump that gay up and get this gay wedding on the road.\r\n\r\n[Hero image credit: Maico Pereira\/Unsplash; featured image credit: ISKRA Photography\/Unsplash]\r\n\r\n\r\nA guide to planning your gay wedding in Thailand\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1931966\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2560\"] Image credit: Kelly Sikkema\/Unsplash[\/caption]\r\nMake a guest list\r\nCertainly one of the worst things brides and grooms first try to manage: who gets to come to our wedding? If you can't invite everyone you know, what about your parents' friends and that local politician? A lot of people list everyone they could think of inviting, then narrow the list down once they have the venue confirmed. Whichever way you do it, always plan your guest list early.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1931967\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2500\"] Image credit: Nikky W.\/Unsplash[\/caption]\r\nBook the venue\r\nPeople have different dream venues when it comes to weddings. The same applies to gay weddings. Of course, hotel ballrooms are one way but that may not be for everyone. Garden weddings provide ample space, beach weddings make a lot of sense for Thailand, or even renting out your favourite restaurant can be an option. While the date is arguably the first thing you set when you plan a wedding, it often also depends on the availability of the dream gay wedding venue, so bear this in mind.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1931968\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2048\"] Image credit: Francesco Liotti\/Unsplash[\/caption]\r\nChoose a theme\r\nMany dream up an image of the traditional black and white wedding with suits and gowns, and that's fully fine, but some people may beg to differ on that level of formality. A lot of couples consider themed weddings on things they like, be it something as simple as a colour scheme, or a full-on theme. We've heard of Star Wars-themed weddings before.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1931973\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2560\"] Image credit: Noelle Rebekah\/Unsplash[\/caption]\r\nSend out invites\r\nYou want to make sure people come attend, and RSVP so you can finalise the number of guests. Most places recommend sending out invites six to eight weeks before the date, but it's not uncommon to do it before that. Do what feels right for you. You can even send out a 'Save the Date' if your wedding details aren't get finalised.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1931969\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2560\"] Image credit: Vitaly Gariev\/Unsplash[\/caption]\r\nTalk to vendors\r\nThere are so many things that go into making a wedding function: photographer, caterers, drinks, cake, florists, more decors, we could go on and on. It's normal to plan and call up vendors 6-8 months in advance to get it over with. Some even hire a wedding planner to help ease the troubles, if it fits within the budget. In Thailand, there are several gay wedding planners available.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1931970\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2500\"] Image credit: Thomas AE\/Unsplash[\/caption]\r\nShop for what to wear for the big day\r\nMany couples say it's the magical moment of seeing yourself in your wedding outfit that gives them the push to seal the deal. Whether you're going for the traditional white dress, black suits and ties, traditional or themed costumes, you'll feel like a monarch when you see that outfit.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1931972\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2560\"] Image credit: Photos by Lanty\/Unsplash[\/caption]\r\nCreate a seating chart\r\nWhen you think you have it all down pat, the last few questions arise. One of them is \"who's sitting with who?\" Some go with round tables, some do long tables, but the headache is all the same. Our friends, our parents' guests, those we haven't met since college; so many names, so little time. Get in those RSVPs, and create your seating chart early on. There will be changes made for sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1931975\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2560\"] Image credit: ISKRA Photography\/Unsplash[\/caption]\r\nRealise it's the same as planning a 'straight' wedding\r\nWho would have known? Make your Thailand gay wedding as gay as you want to, or as traditional, or as bright and colourful. Hire a stripper, hire multiple strippers. Put rainbows everywhere, or don't. Gay weddings are becoming legal in Thailand now, and it's your wedding.

From the outerwear, the iconic Gommino shoes to the bags, this timeless and elegant collection truly places a strong emphasis on quality and classic Italian craftsmanship.

After selling incredible perfume, their expansion into the beauty market got us wondering what they had in store for us. What we discovered was a gorgeous deep red lipstick called Rouge Triomphe, the first of the 15 shades released. It has a satin texture and feels smooth and comfortable once applied to the lips. Of course, the packaging is classic CELINE interpreted by Hedi Slimane. Chic and stylish, it exudes a 60s vibe with the gold tube engraved with the iconic Triomphe symbol. CELINE BEAUT\u00c9 will be launched in fall 2024, followed by a full line in January 2024. \u2013 Pannatorn Tamnipanon, Senior Writer\r\nCrystal & Flower Healing Workshop by @soulmattersbysom\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1931285\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1536\"] Image Credit: Instagram @soulmattersbysom[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn our daily lives, many of us simply want to get through the day.

PACHAREE creates pieces that highlight the unique qualities of each pearl and gemstone in a way that honours their origin while showcasing their natural elegance. Their collection, \"Joy,\" was inspired by a trip to Les Roches Rouges and evokes the feeling of the Atlantic Ocean, moonlight shimmer, and crashing blue waves. Each piece in the show was carefully styled, paying close attention to detail to enhance the overall appearance. We particularly loved the layered necklaces and the stylish statement earrings featuring pearls with hand-sculpted gold settings. \u2013T.C., Content Writer\r\nGucci SS25 collection\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1931280\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2560\"] Image Credit: Gucci[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSabato De Sarno has introduced the concept of \"Casual Grandeur\" for Gucci since becoming their Creative Director. Since his debut, he has continued to develop this idea in his latest SS25 collection. The collection features classic tailoring, lingerie, and the use of leather in a 60s silhouette with a modern touch of glamour. It\u2019s giving young, rebellious, and daring as we saw leather coats, shorts, A-lined minis, ruffled jumpsuits and skirts, along with head accessories and 60s style sun hats. \u2013 P.T., Senior Writer\r\nSofia Vergara\u2019s unflavoured gelatin\r\nhttps:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@meliasayda\/video\/7396388477975285035\r\n\r\nAfter hearing Sofia Vergara\u2019s skincare secret on how she maintains her youthful look, I obviously had to try to make unflavoured gelatin. Knowing that our bodies lose collagen when we turn 30, I ran to the grocery store right away to pick up plain gelatin. All you need is 3 cups of boiling water and 3 tablespoons of unflavoured gelatin powder. However, if that is too plain, you can blend some watermelon or use unsweetened juice. Now, I don\u2019t know if this actually works, but there\u2019s no harm in trying something that may (or may not) make you stay young forever. \u2013T.C., Content Writer\r\nFerragamo SS25 collection\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1931284\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2560\"] Image Credit: Ferragamo[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAnother noteworthy brand that caught our eye at Milan Fashion Week was Ferragamo, whose SS25 collection was infused with the art of ballet. Creative Director Maximilian Davis drew inspiration from ballet attire and the allure of the 1980s for this new collection, giving of a \u2018deconstructed\u2019 feel. What\u2019s particularly interesting is his experimentation with accessories, especially ties. For example, the footwear, whether they're ballet flats or heels, feature matte silk ribbons that are super cute. \u2013 P.T., Senior Writer"},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"What to do in Bangkok: 24-30 September 2024","position":36,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/whats-on\/events-whats-on\/things-to-do-in-bangkok-24-30-september-2024-food-drink-events\/","description":"There are always exciting events happening every week in the city.

The pygmy hippo was born on July 10, 2024 to parents Jonah and Tony, and is the seventh of their offspring. Her name was chosen through a public vote, to which over 20,000 selected the name Moo Deng. The name fits the scheme of her family, with two of her brothers and sisters' name being Moo Wan (sweetened pork), Moo Tun (stewed pork), and Pha Loh (pork belly stew).\r\n\r\nIn Thai, \"moo deng\" translates directly to \"bouncy pork.\" It is a form of minced pork kneaded to give it a bouncy texture, and used commonly with noodle dishes, tom yum, and more \u2014 a fitting name for the adorable, bouncy pygmy hippo.\r\nMoo Deng: A star is born\r\nIt is hard to pinpoint which photo made her go viral, as Moo Deng's antics in photo form were first posted on Khao Kheow Open Zoo's Facebook page, and are now spread all over social media, prominently on Twitter (also known as X). People have found joy, humour, and in many cases, relatability.\r\n\r\nEver since Moo Deng has been catapulted into stardom, the zoo's number of daily visitors reportedly doubled in early September, 2024. The zoo announced that they have limited-edition merchandise featuring our baby girl, including pants and shirts, in production.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/mrmatthouse\/status\/1833934980621214060\r\nMoo Deng vs. the world (of unruly visitors)\r\nIs Moo Deng the Britney Spears of the animal kingdom? While not on the cover, the adorable creature even made it into\u00a0TIME magazine, and has featured in a beauty campaign for Sephora Thailand.\r\n\r\nHowever, stardom is not without its thorns. Videos surfaced of visitors pelting objects at Moo Deng inside the hippo enclosure to wake her up, and splashing her with water to make her move. This made netizens become concerned with Moo Deng's safety, condemning those visitors' actions, while calling for the zoo to increase security.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Khao Kheow Open Zoo threatened legal action to those harassing Moo Deng, and have installed security cameras around the enclosure.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/C_xmaS3Nod4\/\r\nMoo Deng gets a 24\/7 livestream\r\nThat's right: our Thai star got a 24\/7 livestream on Zoodio. It's the perfect way to see how Moo Deng is doing without having to travel to Chon Buri to visit her in person, along with many other zoo animals including orangutangs, capybaras, anteaters, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate September 2024: Limit on visiting times and other regulations\r\nDue to the virality of Moo Deng, the zoo reports 700-800 visitors during weekdays, and up to 6,000-7,000 during weekends. In order to accommodate the number of people, and to ensure the pygmy hippo's safety, the zoo has enacted the following policies:\r\n\r\n \tA maximum of five minutes of viewing time with groups capped at 30-50 people\r\n \tNew pathway to encourage and lead visitors to see other attractions after seeing Moo Deng\r\n \tThe enclosure is now equipped with security cameras\r\n \tWarning signs in Thai, English, and Chinese to warn people about anti-animal cruelty law\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that pygmy hippopotamuses such as Moo Deng are included within the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of endangered species, labeled as an endangered species with a decreasing population trend. The number of mature pygmy hippos in the wild is estimated to be fewer than 2,500 worldwide.\r\n\r\nIf you want to visit Moo Deng and another pygmy hippos, you can find out more information at Khao Kheow Open Zoo."},{"@type":"WebPage","name":"Weekly Obsessions: Maewkhoo Thrifted, Le Labo, and more","position":41,"url":"https:\/\/www.lifestyleasia.com\/bk\/whats-on\/weekly-obsessions-maewkhoo-thrifted-le-labo-and-more\/","description":"Welcome back to\u00a0LSA\u2019s Weekly Obsessions, where we share a few things we\u2019re currently mad about \u2014 because if it\u2019s on our radar, it should definitely be on yours, too.

Containing seaweed extract and the brand's proprietary Opal Skin Algae Complex, this gem is supposed to help stimulate the skin's collagen production, making it plump, smooth, and moisturised. And besides the beneficial ingredients, another aspect we love is the texture. As it\u2019s designed to be a watery essence, this serum absorbs into the skin fairly quickly and doesn\u2019t leave that sticky feeling. The Pro-Collagen Future Restore Serum will be available at all ELEMIS counters from September 16. \u2013 Pannatorn Tamnipanon, Senior Writer\r\n\r\n\r\nAla\u00efa Winter\/Spring 25'\r\n[embed]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xM4nplrsfiE&t=65s[\/embed]\r\n\r\nAs the cult leader in mesh shoes last summer, Ala\u00efa continues to set viral trends with their latest Winter\/Spring 25 collection.
